This is the same area where we had the large fall roost last year (8-31-14). I would estimate the number at 200, all looking very fresh. Did not expect to see a group of Monarchs this early in the season.<p>The photo was taken around noon or shortly after on 8-15. I went out on 8-16 and found a similar number of Monarchs in the same area but they had moved a bit to avoid the wind that had switched to the northwest overnight. They where in smaller roosts, the largest was about 60 in number and easily 200 total for the site. I have to assume the Monarchs were there on 8-14 as well but I did not check for them. It was hot, 97F with wind out of the south when I got to our farm on 8-14 at about 3 pm. The wind was strong from the south and it was hot on Saturday (8-15) so the Monarchs were down low shaded in the grass and a Smooth wild rose thicket. This should give you some idea of the temperatures for the time period.http://w1.weather.gov/data/obhistory/KFAR.htmlWe have about 200 acres of Tallgrass prairie on our farm, some native and some restored. The site where the Monarchs were located is a prairie remnant of about 10 acres with two areas of medium maturity ( 60 foot) Cottonwood trees surrounded by native grass and forbs. This has been a staging area over the years as the Monarchs can always escape the wind whatever the direction. The vegetation is very lush this year on this site coupled with the shade from the trees offers a good place to stay cool in the heat. We do not raise Monarchs but make our best effort to provide habitat for them. On the 160 acres of restored prairie I own and manage no chemicals are used and we time maintenance burns prior to the arrival of the Monarchs. Our grassland is part of a larger contiguous grassland complex (privately owned) that borders Campbell beach of glacial Lake Agassiz. Most of this grassland is undisturbed and provides ideal summer habitat for the Monarchs. Some is native Tallgrass prairie and some is restored and a fen area runs parallel to the glacial beach.",https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2015/08/1439668728.jpg,2015-08-15,2015,8,August,33

On our 60 mile round trip to River Falls, we saw about 17 monarchs, most of them NOT flying directionally south.  This evening, I spent two hours at a field of mixed alfalfa and red clover; I estimate 30 to 50 monarchs in the field.  I finally followed some of them to their roost area where various roosts were formed, varying from three to ten or more in size.......one roost of thirteen in different parts of one branch were counted as one (photo attached).A beautiful night.  Temps in the 60s.  The monarchs fed heavily, preferring the red clover.  Monarchs were in perfect condition.

We have been tagging since 2001 and this is the fastest we have ever tagged.  There were many more monarchs nectaring in the fields and we probably could have tagged at least another 100.  <p>I would have to estimate the number to be over 250.  Usually we start at one end of the field, walk to the other end, turn around and walk back.  Then we would turn around and repeat the process because new monarchs are always flying in.  In past years we would eventually move to a new field because there weren't any around after three or four trips through the field.  This year we go through the field once and we were done with our 100 tags.  At times I was walking around with four butterflies in my net because there were so many around that I didn't want to stop to tag them.  Last year we only had 50 tags.  It took us two days and about seven hours to use them up.  Many more monarchs this year.  <p>I don't know if the monarchs arrived on that day.  When you drive past a big alfalfa field, you may catch sight of a monarch or two, but you actually have to get out into the field to see the large number that we saw.  If you would of been standing on the road and looking at this particular field you would of never realized how many were in it. Last Friday's (8/31) weather was around 78-80 degrees and somewhat windy (10-15 mph).  The monarchs had to hang onto the alfalfa flowers harder so they stayed on them longer which  made it easier to net them.",,2015-08-21,2015,8,August,34

Instead of forming on one of two high lone trees (that did attract a lot of attention), the monarchs rejected those trees and moved lower.  I moved to one of those possible choices just in time to find a roost.

It appeared all the Monarchs did the same.Meanwhile, the nighthawks were moving in great numbers from the east to the west about 300 feet high. We observe many were dipping as they do when catching food. We were concerned at first the nighthawks were feeding on the Monarchs.  But after careful observations we concluded they were NOT feeding on Monarchs but other insects above the Monarchs elevations.We were able to determine with good accuracy the elevations of the Monarchs and the nighthawks due to the 70 - 80 ft trees that surrounds our home.

Inland, the wind was NW at 7 mph, but it was northeast off the lake at 10-14 mph.We believe that the monarchs actually crossed Lake Huron from Canada. If they came from the Bruce Peninsula area of Canada, directly due east of us, it would take at least 6 hours to cross on a good&nbsp;NE&nbsp;wind on steady wing beats.&nbsp;Alternatively, maybe they had been blown over the lake from somewhere to our north and were working their way inland.

I then went to the nature center, where friends and I did an open house event from 9am to noon.  I then left my monarch displays at the nature center, and headed to the lighthouse grounds to join Nikki King, Leah and Ed from OSU for a monarch tagging program.  Nikki, Leah and Ed helped visitors tag, while I worked in the garden and answered visitors' questions about the garden.  I found 7 monarch larvae in the garden, ranging from 3rd to 5th instar--mostly 4ths. It was sunny, low 60s, slight wind from the north. I then returned to the nature center and packed up my stuff just before closing.  As I packed, I noted a cold and strong W/NW wind had moved in.   The winds escalated considerably over the next few hours, forcing organizers to cancel the memorial flare event that evening.  Waves crashed over the breakwall downtown, as over 1000 scouts huddled in tents on the grounds of Perry's monument.  Temps were in the low 50s.

I arrived before the sun was up, and watched as the east sky purpled with the morning light. It was 52F, winds WNW at 5-10 mph.  At 6:45 am, I walked up to the hackberry trees, scanning the treeline for monarchs.  I found 300, resting in clusters of 1-2 dozen, scattered throughout the treeline about 15-20 feet up.  I used my flash to photograph them initially, and found a tagged monarch with code UNW 487.  As the sun continued to rise, the clusters began to softly light up.  I noted 100 more monarchs in the daylight, which I had not seen in the early dawn light.  By 7:45 am, the sun was shining directly on some of the trees, and monarchs began to bask.  When the sun's rays hit them enough to warm them sufficiently, they would burst from the trees in groups of around a dozen, flying just 10-20 feet from the trees before immediately circling back and landing on the trees--landing so they were further apart, and basking.  More and more began to bask.  The early morning light now created glare, and I was thankful I had come so early to photograph them when the lighting was softer.  A total of 400 monarchs!

Here is her response:I blew up the image and actually counted 4 confirmed Queens and perhaps 3 others that were impossible to confirm. It's now uncommon for us to find a few Queens mixed in with Monarchs when we are netting large clusters at night. We also find black swallowtails as well. In a cluster of a single netting of 76 butterflies we could find a swallowtail and a queen, but not every time.I do wonder if Queens are moving with the Monarchs and being counted. I suspect so, but not in sufficient numbers to skew any data. This was not a BIG fall for Queens. I had a few in August, but they were light in number. There were far more Queens in the early Spring than later.In contrast, back in 2010 (I believe) we had large numbers of Monarchs moving straight south from Abilene, Tx, Between Abilene and San Angelo 90 mi.

There were Gulf Fritillaries and Monarchs and Buckeyes every where! The Fritillaries are in their peak migration to the Florida peninsula and the Monarchs are in their peak migration to Mexico, so they are both all over the beaches. They were all feeding on several species of yellow asters and wild lantana. The Monarchs in the dunes seemed mostly intent on feeding, others on the beach were mostly flitting towards the west and out over the Gulf. It was sunny, temps in the high sixties and there was a strong northeasterly wind, approximately ten to twelve mph which was making it easy for the Monarchs but difficult for the Fritillaries. It was quite exhilarating to see all of the many butterflies! <p> They (monarchs and fritillaries) were out flying everywhere along Hwy 98 (which follows the beach for about two miles), the areas between the highway and the dunes, the dunes (which have various species of yellow asters which they flock to) and the beach. All up and down the strip.  I am sure there were much more than 100 in that distance. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t have a camera with me.  But this phenomenon is still taking place, so I guess I should head back out to the beach and take a few shots. I was only there for about fifteen minutes with my husband. We went specifically to check them out. I wanted to show him up close. I have been going there frequently for the past two weeks to watch the hundreds and hundreds of fritillaries that migrate through (incidentally, this visit was the first time I saw any monarchs there).  That in itself is an exciting spectacle to see. On some days you can stand at the edge of the dunes and watch them fly right by you in groups of twenty to thirty, one group after the other.  Of course, each year they are migrating east to the peninsula of Florida (I am located in the panhandle of Fla.) so most of them follow the beach. During this visit, you could see the fritillaries heading east and the monarchs attempting to head west (the east wind was making it difficult for them, though). We have a pavilion and boardwalk down to the beach. Between the pavilion and the dunes on the beach, there is a closed in stretch which is filled with these flowering plants that the different species of butterflies all flock to for nectaring. Relating to your last question, just right in this small area, I would say it was about equal numbers feeding, flitting around and flying westerly.",,2015-10-18,2015,10,October,42

They took shelter in the pine tree which was nearby.Currently (10/21), winds are from the S-SW.

Extensive nectar sources, primarily goldenrod, Eupatorium, Baccharis, over many acres (this is an overgrown, elevated berm along Mississippi Sound, not sure of elevation but at least 30 ft).

Our surveys end at the end of October, so I wouldn&rsquo;t normally have a chance to say how long the roost lasts.  If it&rsquo;s important, we can probably get permission to check a couple of times (it&rsquo;s a restricted access site).In general, we see a lot of monarchs on the beaches of Jackson County Mississippi, especially along marshes and dunes that have been allowed to vegetate with flowering plants.  This has been true as long as I&rsquo;ve lived here (since 2005).  They probably took a big hit after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 because there were no flowers on the coast that year, but nobody was counting.

90356,1446392970,2015-10-31,Monarch PEAK Migration,200,30.23,-97.714," I saw hundreds on Monarchs in Austin.  Surprising!  I saw more monarchs in 30 minutes than Iâ€™ve seen all year.  Bright, fresh, long winged migrating monarchs of both sexes.  Weâ€™ve had a couple rainy days with strong winds out of the south, so I should not be surprised to see Monarchs that had hunkered down.  They were sunning themselves and nectaring on evergreen sumac blooms which were plentiful and covered with numerous other insects. (sunny temp  65df)  The preserve manager said they had been there the day before as well.Hereâ€™s the funny thing, I went a quarter mile away to another nature preserve with similar vegetation, and there were none.  I saw none on the rest of the day even though I was outside observant, and I drove up and down all over Austin including over several really tall overpasses where I sometimes get up into migrating monarchs.So my question: I know many butterflies â€œhill topâ€ as a means of coming together and facilitating meeting mates.  The preserve where I saw the monarchs is among the tallest in a hilly area.  Locally known as lone tree hill. Are monarchs known to hill top?  It does not really make sense?  Years ago, I saw roosts in the Kerrville area the morning after a strong cold front (similar conditions) which were down in a valley along a creek.  That location to emerge after hunkering down makes a lot more sense.

The monarchs are slowly settling into their mountaintop colony this year; so far their nighttime roosts have been spread out, and forest rangers have been keeping their locations secret. It's clear though that the butterflies have shifted sites since last year. The last two seasons the monarch chose stands of trees at Carditos, on the west side of Cerro Pelon. This year there are many to be seen flying about the mountaintop meadow known as El Llano de Tres Gobernadores, which they have not visited since early 2012. Yesterday as we were watching them fly over El Llano the clouds rolled in and suddenly the butterflies picked the tallest oyamel tree in sight, right along the border of the clearing, and turned the lower top part of the tree orange.

I first noticed about monarchs (M) flitting about while I was working on the house, about15-20 minutes before sundown on Aug 31.  I followed to where there were a dozen or so flitting about.  That is when I noticed the cluster on the tree of about 21 or so.  There were many more still flying around then. That was yesterday 8-31-2016.  If they roosted before I did not notice.  I was surprised that they picked such a small black walnut tree.  There are several other much larger BW trees nearby.  Usually they seem to like my big spruce trees.  (80-100ft planted in 1914) I walked around the shelterbelt and saw many more still flying around.  I found another cluster higher up in a green ash deeper in the shelterbelt. But by that time I could not see how many had landed on that tree because there was not enough light.  I just know there was real close because of the concentration of M in that close area.        As for nectar,  My pastures are covered by red clover this year.  I always have a bunch, but this year is extraordinary.  I could cut it for hay, but I don&rsquo;t need it.  There are also numerous wild flowers around.  I have noticed quite a few had been hanging out by my grapes and flying back and forth from them to the mulberry tree.  I wonder if they were getting any sugars from the damaged grapes the birds left me?        This morning (9/1) the temperature was 56 F.  Yesterday hit 84, by this time it was still in the high 70&rsquo;s.  Really light SE breeze 2-3 mph, less than 5mph I&rsquo;m certain.  The M were shielded from the breeze as this was a special condition.  Really light breeze, taller grass, and the trees haven&rsquo;t started to drop their leaves yet.  In a normal year the black walnuts would have already dropped their leaves.  The wind can get in where the M were. But the breeze was too weak. That is why I usually see the roosts on the big spruces.  The BW they were in is only 8-10 ft high.  The M were only 6 ft off the ground. The photo I have was taken about 10 minutes before sundown.  At that time there were just as many, if not more, still flying around than were roosted.

Friday I saw 2 dozen passing through Arcadia Lookout over Lake Michigan over a period of about 45 minutes. For those who are unfamiliar with the geography, Arcadia is the highest natural point on Lake Michigan. It was an amazing sight as each monarch was traveling separately, and it was like an assembly line.

All this past week I have noticed considerable numbers of monarchs, more than I have seen all year, suggesting the migration was at its peak here in southern Nebraska. One of our prairies in particular, which is largely dominated by late blooming forbs (sunflowers and the like), was full of monarchs fueling up for their migration. I guessed, correctly, that they would roost in the treeline immediately south of the prairie. On September 9, 2016, I counted a minimum of 400 individuals in a small section of that treeline- there may have been closer to 500, but I prefer to underestimate. The attached photo is of the largest cluster, which contained approximately 100 individuals. I also have photos of many smaller clumps ranging from 25 - 75 individuals on other trees. All seemed to be in excellent condition - they all looked very fresh, good coloring, no torn wings or battered individuals that I could see. The following day I saw far fewer on the wing, and could find none roosting at dusk, so I'm assuming they moved on. Apologies for the poor quality of the photo - it is the best photo I could get considering all I had was the camera on my phone and it was dusk.",https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2016/09/1464677381.jpg,2016-09-09,2016,9,September,36

After watching 3 unsuccessfully attempt the lake crossing at Holiday Beach we were hopeful to find some in a similar predicament at Pelee.  By 18:30 the wind had subsided but the temperature was still a warm 20C at sunset.  Watched a small cluster of approximately 20 gradually form near a Hackberry tree as the sun was sinking lower.   They refused to settle and kept fluttering and disturbing each other. At sunset as we were leaving (20:00) spotted 2 separate individuals roosting in 2 separate trees on either side of the tip path. One was a female and the other's wing was hidden behind a leaf. An anthropomorphic observation would be that these fellows with their gregarious behaviour were casual about their journey and not as serious and driven as the ones we have witnessed later in the autumn with colder temperatures and shorter daylight in previous years.

The location is in a treeline with restored prairie on one side and corn/soybean cropland on the other. The prairie side supports all their favourite nectar sources.  They moved around the trees to protect from wind.  Many branches averaged 15-20 or more of resting monarchs.  Over several trees at least 150+ not counting all the ones you couldn't see because they looked like dead leaves. On these same two days I also saw smaller swarms of monarchs on my farmstead about 4 miles west of Glacier Creek Preserve.

After parking we walked back along the road to find a group of 10 or 12 trying to roost in a Hackberry tree on the East side of the tip road in strong winds. We left them and headed further South passing another 12 heading North presumably they joined the first group. Watched many more join a roost already forming in one of the historical roost trees (Hackberry). This one numbered at least 100 at this point. A fellow Monarch enthusiast pointed out a small roost of 6 which had already formed even further South directly over the main tip trail almost at the tip. The sun had now set.  While trying to decide where to look next my son almost collided with a Monarch headed North up the trail from the direction of Lake Erie. So we headed out on the sand and witnessed Monarchs flying off the lake from the Southeast and Southwest seemingly appearing out of nowhere flapping furiously to avoid being carried back out over the lake. We followed them to the large roost which kept growing in the fading light. We suspect there may be many more in isolated roosts wherever they could find refuge for the night.  My concern is for the ones who may have not made landfall. People in Ohio on the southshore of Lake Erie should be on the lookout tomorrow.

It was 5pm.The location is rural north-western Illinois.  Our road is a country/gravel road with relatively few houses and a lot of farm/pasture land surrounding it.  The monarchs themselves situated in a field between our 6 acre parcel (mostly unmowed and left to grow wild) and a farmer&rsquo;s large alfalfa field. They were situated in a line of trees on the fence row bordering the farmer&rsquo;s field.  The land around is a sort of manicured prairie area with a path mowed around the perimeter for walking.  The man who owns it burns it off early each spring, and what grows back is a mixture of very tall and lovely grasses, clovers, and some wildflowers. The farmer&rsquo;s field adjacent to it appears to have been planted with alfalfa this year, and parts of it are being used as grazing area for cattle.    The temperature dipped into the mid 50&rsquo;s.  It was a very still night.  There wasn&rsquo;t even enough wind to make the tall prairie grasses sway.  If there had been any wind, the monarchs would not have been shielded from the wind positioned as they were.  The trees are on a crest of a hill in an area of hills and valleys.   I can say that 100% of the monarchs were on the sides of the trees that faced south and west.  I was told by my neighbor (the one who owns that property) that the monarchs come every year to their field and that they stay about a week.

106477,1473778683,2016-09-16,Monarch PEAK Migration,1000,41.407,-82.41,"Starting at about 5:30pm, we were sitting on our patio facing Lake Erie. Calm weather. Suddenly we saw wave after wave of Monarchs coming along the lake shore heading westward. This continued for at least one hour. Our patio is on a small bluff perhaps 20 feet above the lake level. They were typically above us but many flew right by us at our level. Mainly along the lakeshore but some were actually over the water. There were successive waves. At the peak I estimate at least 100 per minute slowing as the time progressed. It was one of the most amazing things we have ever seen. A few stopped momentarily on flowers, but they were mainly busily migrating, not stopping to feed.The entire event was actually at least two solid hours. At first there were a few in the flowers and I thought that was nice since we have not seen many in the last few years. Then I noticed they were fluttering by the window facing the lake, so I went outside and saw they were coming in a swath roughly from the east along the lake shore and headed roughly west. We live about two miles west of Vermilion Ohio on the lake front. The peak hour was the second hour, and I would estimate the peak truly was a 100 or so in a one, maybe two minute period. Hard to say for sure, but I was so stunned. In the middle of the peak I could look up, to the lake, back south to the landward side, or, best of all, some went along side me or right over my head! You could see them materialize as they headed towards us and then they were past and gone. Some were very deliberate in moving on, some were playing a bit, and some stopped on some of the flowering plants but did not stay long on them. I think I must have had a very foolish grin on my face because watching them just made me want to laugh!&nbsp;Some were every high in the air. As high as some very large old maples that we have in our area. Others were below the level of our patio, slightly. Our patio is about 20 feet above lake level where we are. Most were at our level or somewhat above, maybe up to 20-30 feet above our patio level.&nbsp;Prior to the peak I would estimate they started passing 10 or so per minute when I really knew something was starting to happen, then ramped up from that to the peak and then ramped down. Even after it was 'over' every now and again a straggler would fly by, but if I had not seen the main event I never would have thought it was part of a migration.&nbsp;I would say the 'peak' period was a good solid 10 minutes with fall off on both sides. So I would have estimated 10 minutes @ 100/minute = 1,000 monarchs. Yes, there were that many! You could smooth the before and after to follow the shape of your curve, and I think you would have it. Interestingly, when we see the duck migrations, they are almost all in giant flocks during the 'peak', with very few before and after.&nbsp; The Monarchs are a bit more 'mercurial' in their behavior, but the so called peak was flockish as well.It had been a rainy afternoon, but when&nbsp;the migration event&nbsp;happened the skies had cleared, and the winds were calm, maybe 5mph or so off the lake. Pleasant temperature, maybe 75F or so.&nbsp;I did not get any pictures sorry to say. They were spread out enough it would have been hard to do it justice, and I did not want to miss any of it. But here is a picture (taken in the spring). I was standing on the grass and the Monarchs were coming toward me. I was facing NE and they first became visible at about the treeline over the beach.We used to have more milkweed in our area than we do today, but I did notice a few plants coming back, so I am glad about that. But, they must have already fed for the day since they were mainly moving past our area.&nbsp;",https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2016/09/1473778683.jpg,2016-09-16,2016,9,September,37

The edge of the alfalfa is approx. 100 feet from the willows. There is also wild golden rod in the immediate area.  We also have patches of clover in bloom. It is an uncultivated clover. Big red clover to be exact.  According to wunderground weather,  the nighttime lows got to the middle to high 50's I will guess the temperatures at roosting time were in the middle 70 range.

They would flutter in the air at the same time but only for a few seconds and then would land back onto the same patch of golden rod.  They were already present when we arrived and were still present when we left. They were very much undisturbed and not bothered by our presence. As we drove around Lucas Park, we observed several more patches of golden rod (the park was full of golden rod), but only observed maybe 10-20 on each patch elsewhere. The 3 patches by the swimming beach was by far the largest grouping.  This would be a great location for observing and tagging in the future if they return there.

They were settling in and continued to fill the branches and I realized right away what was happening.   It was calm and cool Friday evening.  56 degrees.  Nice nearly-full moon.  As far as any nectar source, I can&rsquo;t think of any.  Some were drinking from my hum feeders but they mostly just came in and landed or flew on south.  ( I could see them in the distance north coming in in large numbers.)   As I look at the pictures and video I took, I had more than 100 here, and they all spent the night. (I checked on them several times with flashlight)  In the morning, there was a pretty good breeze coming from the north.  They waited until the sun hit them  (they were all on the east side of the trees) and they stretched their wings for a while (it was rather chilly) and they flew.

Three roosts formed on Ken's high ash tree, 4 to 8 in each.  Plus, there were lots of scattered monarchs in other trees.  I estimate a couple of dozen...compared to the maybe 40 or so Saturday night.  I suspect these were almost all different monarchs.

We suspect there were more roosts as anecdotal reports stated the monarchs were flying everywhere in the high winds just prior to sunset. The tree cover is thick and the trails are limited so observers are not always able to follow the Monarchs' flight. Another friend in our group said one of his friends had located a roost in a Walnut tree in the West beach parking lot further North in the park.

Pelee. This is by far the highest count this year at this location. Up until a week or 10 days ago Monarchs around here have been as scarce as hens' teeth. All the butterflies that I observed to day were flying about 200 feet above Lake Erie shore-line cliffs (Orford bluffs) at Clearville Park. They were all flying at a leisurely pace with a small tail wind driving them forward. Unfortunately this didn't last long because a  storm front came through after about 1 hour of observation which shifted the winds to the west. I think the butterflies used that opportunity to drop down in the trees in the surrounding forest or risk be driven out over the lake which is 80 miles wide at this point.     ,,2016-09-23,2016,9,September,38

It was in this second roost that I spotted a tagged Monarch!  I got a picture and called the phone number on it and reported the tag number.  I hope at some point I might get an e-mail letting me know where it was tagged at in the beginning! I noticed them at about 7:30 a.m.  It was quite windy with a cold front moving through.  The sun was warming them but the wind was too much to take off and fly.  They spent another night here.

All appeared to be very healthy and about an equal number of males and females. The 1,000 was just an early plugged guestimate.

None were successful in the high wind.  Observed one individual flapping northward but being carried South.   Others were picked up and carried over the treetops to the East Beach.   Met a friend leaving to resume her family Thanksgiving dinner who directed us to look in this season's roost tree.  Along our way we spoke with another visitor who indicated she had seen about 30 trying to roost on the East Beach.  With daylight waning we went directly to the Hackberry tree where we watched as more Monarchs joined a group already settled in on the leeward side at the very top.  Observed three clusters and some singles.  I did not realize how tightly they were clustered until I started counting.  In virtually the same area of tree as our 175 roost from 10/02 I counted 257!

At the west end of the island there were hundreds of monarchs roosting and sunning on the dunes and in the brush! Hurricane may have put them off course!! They are in beautiful condition!I saw them coming from the ocean onto the beach and flying around the dunes. I went to the backside of the island and found them in the low brush. It was only 60 degrees so they were grouped together in clumps . I had to run 2 miles home to get my camera and bike. When I got back they had moved back further so I traipsed through the brush in the dunes and found them in every bush. They were starting to warm up and were starting to fly around. I believe they are starting to go toward the intercoastal waterway. I think the hurricane delayed them.Bird Island NC Coastal Reserve is adjacent to Sunset Beach, NC on the border of north and South Carolina. It is a 2 1/2 mile walk on the beach to get to it. I have been seeing monarchs sporadically all summer. I just moved here on the island. The hurricane compromised the dunes so access to the back side of the island is easier. Previously you could not walk on the dunes. The trees grow in clusters and when I went back this afternoon I found dozens of clusters with monarchs. I will try and get back early in the morning (10/12) when they are less active and get a count. The ones I saw on the beach were all moving toward the trees.

Our university has two dedicated butterfly gardens that include Gregg's Blue Mist, milkweed, aster, turk's cap, salvia, lantana and roses - all of those are still in bloom - as well as vitex trees. One of those gardens is at my building - we've had a lot of individual monarchs and queens here, but I haven't seen any roosts (no big trees here).

Clearly southbound by 11:30.       Most were flying right above tallest grass or forbs.  Some were high from passing over the house then most quickly descended.  Direction was SSW essentially straight into the wind.  Wind light about 5, with occasional gusts to 10.  Gusts would blow them off course, but otherwise steady progress.

Reported total includes a few more I saw feeding while on the way to check roosts later.Speculation I could have assumed that the stream was wider than 70 yards, which is not unreasonable since there is no obvious reason they would be strongly channeled by terrain.

Then on Saturday, Oct 22 when there was a strong North Wind, he saw &amp; tagged 11 butterflies over a 3 hour time period.  On Sunday, Oct 23 in the same spot, there were easily 400-500 monarchs.  In a 2 hour time period, he had used up all of his 100 tags, and a volunteer with 25 tags used an unknown number of tags.  He said that for every one he tagged, there were 4-5 that he missed (thus the 400-500 monarch estimate).  Initially, the monarchs were roosting high up in the pines but as the temperatures rose, they began flying out of the trees.  According to my coworker, there was a pretty steady west wind (appx 15mph) and temperatures were in the upper 50s to mid 60s.  It was a sunny day and the smoke from a nearby house fire didn&rsquo;t seem to deter them.  The butterflies were mainly flying, and a few were nectaring on thistle and asters.At my house an hour north of Pt Lookout State Park on the 23rd, I was surprised to see 3 monarchs at 10:30am because it was very windy and still a chilly 55 degrees, but I didn&rsquo;t see any more that day.  Across the bay from my house at Ocean City, Maryland, I noticed that people were reporting sightings of 400-500 monarchs that weekend too. Over the last 2 years since I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of my monarch sightings, I have noticed that we have seen the most monarchs at parks, farms, and houses that border rivers and the Chesapeake Bay, and it seems like our peak migration is mid-October. Some of my notes from last year that may interest you, someone who worked at Pt lookout State Park tagged over 200 monarchs the week of Oct 12-16, 2015.  One of her tags was recovered this winter.  Two coworkers each saw one monarch at 2 different locations along the Patuxent River in Maryland on Dec 15, 2015. I will see if anyone in my coworker&rsquo;s group got some pictures that they&rsquo;d be willing to share from the 23rd at Pt. Lookout State Park so that you can post a picture.Editor's note: We've re-dated this report from 10/23 to 10/22, the night the roost formed.",,2016-10-22,2016,10,October,42

Pleasantly surprised to find a quite of few monarchs and roosting in at least 6 different locations near the shoreline of Lake Huron.  Yesterday was August 23, 2017 and we started our walk of the Park at about 7 PM and noticed the roosts forming. There is an abundance of wildflowers on the wildlands north and south of Tawas Point. Last nights overnight temperature was around 48 degrees Fahrenheit.  Wind direction was out of the northwest, pretty strong when we were out.  Roosts were forming consistently on the east side of trees, shielded from the wind somewhat.  Tawas Point is a peninsula with Lake Huron on the east and west sides.Photo does not do the numbers of monarchs gathered there justice.",https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2017/08/1496334808.jpg,2017-08-23,2017,8,August,34

Beginning at around 11:00 I was noticing one Monarch every couple of minutes.  Around 13:00 we headed toward the tip in hopes of seeing them flying out across Lake Erie.  After getting off the tip shuttle, we took the footpath toward the tip and were still seeing monarchs flying South at the rate of around one per minute. There was a strong wind from the West.  When we reached the tip we noticed them trying to fly out across Lake Erie.  As they left the shelter of land the wind immediately pushed them East.  We watched many struggle against the wind and eventually make their way back to the shelter of the trees on the East Beach in the lee of the wind.  They were not clustering. Many were resting only a metre or two above the sand on Wild Grape, Mulberry and other vegetation.  There was a lot of activity in the lee of the wind. Dozens and dozens of Swallows, Red-winged Blackbirds and dragonflies of various types were chasing swarms of insects and disturbing the resting Monarchs.  Many visitors were able to get close up pictures of the resting Monarchs. Of the ones we were able to identify, the vast majority were male. Temperature was around 24&deg;C, mostly sunny.   The irony of the day is that while we were watching many fly South, we also witnessed at least one female ovipositing on the tiny Milkweed plants growing in the sand at Northwest Beach.  It was quite a thrill for the Junior Naturalists who got to see it happen.  We found two second instar caterpillars as well.

We had been there this morning looking for feeding Monarchs and, because of the rain overnight and the heavy weather, the Monarchs were clinging to the sedge until about 11:30 AM. This seems to be their mini-roost plant of choice since they can remain close to preferred nectar source of Meadow and Rough blazing star.Editor's Note: Monarchs typically roost in trees so this observation of monarchs roosting on a rush is significant &mdash; and shows the value of observations contributed by citizen scientists.

It was already quite warm ,80+, and humid, the wind was from the south.  I had been checking the trees (mostly walnut trees, a couple of choke cherry trees with viburnum, dogwood other shrubs mixed in, because I was tagging Monarchs for the past 3 weeks.

There are soybean and corn fields nearby.  It had been in the mid-sixties overnight and the wind had been quite brisk all the day before--thus I was surprised that the clusters of Monarchs had arrived.  When I am tagging (or observing like yesterday) I notice where the butterflies gather.  I find wind tunnels produced by buildings and obstructions to the south are usually devoid of butterflies.  There will be some clusters on the west side of the trees when the shelter is just right.  There is a small glade facing the east where they will also gather whether the wind is from the north or the south.

BUT, we've had an unusual stretch of very warm, calm weather for about two weeks now. Temperatures are 10-15 degrees above normal and winds have been calm. The two days I was at Sterling there was little to no wind at all.For what it's worth, I have seen the monarchs concentrate is this same spot before. It was the first week of September 2012 or maybe 2013. There were thousands resting in an Aspen tree - a unique and very special memory.",https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2017/09/1506259674.jpg,2017-09-24,2017,9,September,38

The first time I noticed the increased numbers was Sept 14 when I saw 30+ on one of the plants with white flowers. When I went back on Sept 16, I observed many more plants with monarchs feeding. I would estimate 25 plants with 10 to 15 butterflies on each including the original plant I had noticed the first day which seems to have larger numbers of butterflies. (it is on a path where you can see all sides, where other plants are mostly on a hill that is observed from a small bridge, so you only see front face) Prior to the 14th I had only seen one or two monarchs per visit in the previous few weeks - I run to the park a couple times a week. The weather was quite a bit cooler up til then. September 26: I went back to the park today and it seems most of the butterflies have headed south. (Still lots or varieties of bees in large numbers though)Today walking around I saw 15 in singles or pairs flying around and only found 2 plants with groups feeding.   On the large plant with the white flowers I could only see 7 individuals and on the purple aster that I sent photo of last time there were 9. I went back twice to each spot and got the same numbers both times. In terms of the peak numbers last week - I recounted the number of plants where they were feeding and there are only 20, not 25 per my estimate yesterday.

Saw one episode of two small butterflies chasing a monarch off a tree branch.October 8: The first roost we had was Saturday (October 7) and they have been coming in a few at a time every night--just considerably more last night (October 7). I noticed them in the yard in late afternoon, around 5. They finally stopped feeding and started clustering, mostly on mesquites last night, about 6:30--7pm. It was getting dark when I made the count, and only a few were still fluttering in the trees, looking for their spot. Most of them get in clusters hanging down from lower branches; one had 24 butterflies in it. Our 5 acre corner of the fields where we farm is a certified wildlife area with National Wildlife, Xerces, and also a Monarch Waystation. We are located in the midst of wide open fields, now full of cotton about ready to harvest. Very little is blooming, just occasional Mexican hats and a few of the little white native asters. Our yard, however, has sunflowers, lots of blue mist flower, Turks' cap, asters, lantana, salvia, etc. We also leave lots of dead stalks to provide some shelter from wind. We try to be ready for spring and fall migrations. We had a cool front yesterday morning at about 4; daytime temp around 85, last night 55. It warmed quickly this morning. The winds were light by mid-afternoon but had switched to south from earlier when out of the north. The trees are thick enough on the West side of the house in an old pasture to provide good cover from the wind. I think the rare cluster of trees is part of what draws them into our place. They are here in varying numbers nearly every year. We led our Master Naturalist hike at the Abilene State Park yesterday morning, about 60 miles south of us, hoping to have a few Monarchs roosting in the pecan trees.

I felt lucky and glad that the asters and goldenrods were still in bloom for these last monarchs of the season.But yesterday, October 10, brought a glorious day full of a new flood of freshly colored monarchs, gliding down the road and over the causeway, and filling my yard throughout the day -18 max. at one time - on the small white asters (S. ericoides and pilosum mostly) which are the only native nectar plants fully in bloom right now. A stunning and beautiful day with the air full of monarchs everywhere. There is still a little seaside goldenrod, late blue aster (S. patens), and small white asters in bloom for nectaring, but plants are going by quickly now.Winds are forecast to be favorable for the next few days - blowing out of the north and northeast.

The Monarchs were roosting on the east side of the tip in very loose groups mostly on Wild Grape vines and Hackberry trees.

Most Monarchs were relatively low down and loosely grouped which gave us the opportunity to note at least a half dozen with wing damage and deformities. One was missing a hind wing! Others had curvatures on the upper edges of their forewings. This one was hanging on in a precarious spot close to the tip. Part of the reason the photograph is blurry is that her chosen plant was moving so much. She was extremely faded, missing many scales, and her wings did not seem to close properly.

(Rock Rose, Kidneywood, Evergreen Sumac). Many other Monarchs were seen in the fields surrounding Belton Lake which has been a hotspot for them over the last two weeks. The Liatris is mostly past so they've started feeding on Gumweed like crazy! They were also seen on Frostweed too. While I believe there were more Monarchs passing through last week, the peak migration has continued into this week.

But this morning when I saw a monarch feeding on pansies at the North Carolina Arboretum I thought, maybe not.  So, being fairly close already, I drove up the Blue Ridge Parkway to Cherry Gap Overlook (4327 feet elevation), a historically reliable place for monarchs to cross the high ridges.  Arrived at 12:18 pm and right away saw four monarchs floating overhead in a line.  It was partly cloudy, with a airflow from the west, but with southerly breezes at ground level, until later when it was calm.  Some of the earlier monarchs had to fight their way over, and one or two got pushed back or sideways until they eventually made it.  The temperature ranged from between 60 and 70 degrees F.  It was exciting to see the butterflies this late in the year, the so-called Day of the Dead when the first ones are supposed to arrive in the mountains in Mexico.  Once these butterflies reach the lowlands of South Carolina, they will have a better chance of making it all the way, provided they can find food sources.

The sky was mostly sunny and temps between 39-50.  Light breeze from w-sw.  I saw my first flying Monarch about 1115 am and the temperature on my car thermometer was 39!  I saw four others flying low or landing along field edges before I got to the Cable Mill area.  I was at Cable Mill from 1130-1350. The fields around the Cable Mill area in Cades Cove were all mowed in August and used for parking or program site for the eclipse.  Most of the grass is fescue with some red clover but I didn't find any clover with flowers.  I saw a number land in grass or on leaves but observed no flowering plants since we have had a few frosts in Cades Cove.  I later went to Sparks Lane where we have tagged many Monarchs and saw only one there in about 15 minutes and it was quite high.  These fields had not been mowed. The Monarchs were all flying in a general westerly direction.  Most were 3-10' above the ground but some were above treetops and a few very high and difficult to see without binoculars. At times I could see 6-8 within 100 yards of where I was helping with a sorghum demonstration. The elevation in Cades Cove is about 1,800 feet. Once the Monarchs passed by/over Cable Mill they had many miles to fly over forests in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Cherokee National Forest.  Sunday was very overcast and I did not go into the park.  I will go again tomorrow and will report if I see any more.  Weather yesterday and today is cloud, amp and about 50 degrees.I was in Cades Cove on 10/24, 10/27/, 10/31, 11/3 &amp; 11/10 and some days didn't see any Monarchs.  On 11/10 I only saw 2 Monarchs and both were flying quite high over the fields.  On 11/2 I was up on the Foothills Parkway and saw 3 Monarchs flying at about 3,000 feet elevation - it was sunny and about 60 degrees.Capturing and tagging Monarchs in the Cable Mill area allowed me to talk with over 100 people about Monarchs and their migration to Mexico.

We have worked to protect and restore habitat here, including fall flowering native plants, and roosting habitat. Gradually, especially the past two years (2016-2017), we began to find more Monarchs here, both egg laying and migrating.

We had to leave our car on the mainland, and journeyed over to South Bass island.  My wild-collected monarchs have been eclosing the last 2 days, so I was expecting a surge in adult activity.  The storm revealed their presence, as I found 1000 monarchs taking refuge on the leeward side of the trees at the South Bass Island lighthouse grounds.  This is the largest number I have documented here in 5 years, and I have never seen them roost in this particular location on the grounds.  But it was a perfect location, warm and sheltered from the 20-30 mph winds.  I found the roosts by following 2 monarchs that were nectaring in the adjacent sunflower field.  They flew to the trees, and I followed them as they flitted along the trees looking for a place to roost.  They flew over to the other side of the trees, I pursued them, and as I rounded the tree line I was greeted with hackberry and maple trees filled with clusters.

We are experiencing the remnants of Hurricane Gordon, so we have strong wind pushing off of Lake Erie (16-20mph) creating a nor'easter. The water levels are pretty high from a combination of rainfall and lake levels over the past 20 hours. Temps are about 60 degrees F with high humidity. The monarchs are roosting on the western side of the trees out of the wind as much as they can be, but they are still bouncing around like crazy. There are pockets of them low in willows and dogwood, but even more towards the tops of cottonwood and maple trees. They were packed in there so tightly that in spots we thought that the leaves had started to change until we had a closer look! There are also monarchs moving over the marshes in the hundreds. One of the best parts is that the monarchs are resting along the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge's Wildlife Drive and we are able to share this incredible sight with our visitors! Here's a link for the map of the Wildlife Drive (the second page). Every tree had monarchs on it, from South Estuary Avenue thru North Estuary Avenue and parts of Veler Road and Trumpeter Trail, and a small section of Stange Road.

Today the skies were cloudy, temp 70 F with light North-East Wind. The conditions today were excellent for focusing the butterflies to travel along the Lake Erie shoreline in a SW direction.  There were so many butterflies it was almost impossible to count them. There were some butterflies dropping to the ground looking for nectar but the vast majority where gliding on the wind well above tree height. Many were up 2 or 3 times tree height &ndash; and many more were much higher, gliding on the wind. At one point, there were so many the sky was a black cloud of butterflies against a cloudy-sky background. I conservatively estimate 10-15 thousand per hour passing through from 12:00 noon until 5:00 PM. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t have my camera with me. If we have a repeat of weather conditions in the next few days with a northeast wind (the key factor) I&rsquo;ll be sure to have my camera.When the wind is from the north east it forces the butterflies to fly along the shore-line which concentrates them in large numbers. This is a pattern I have seen in previous years which is why Clearville Park is a good place to see the migration provided the wind cooperates.  They don&rsquo;t like to go over water unless they have to. They prefer to fly in a south- west direction because if you continue in that direction it will take you to Mexico. September 10 addition: Pt. Pelee is 50 miles due south-west of Clearville Park on the Lake Erie shore so is in the direction that the butterflies are flying. Pt. Pelee is the southernmost tip of Canada and is a National Park. Monarchs form large roosts there waiting for weather conditions to take them across the lake to Ohio.  Because of the number of butterflies that we witnessed on Friday (9/7) at Clearville Park they should start showing up in large numbers at Pt. Pelee in a few days. It will take a few days because the weather after our sighting on Friday has been dominated by the remnants of Tropical Storm Gordon with very strong 40 MPH east winds so it is unlikely that they would make any progress in such poor conditions. The weather conditions are expected to improve tomorrow (9/11).   ",,2018-09-07,2018,9,September,36

Most were low down in Oak trees in the lee of the North-east wind and rain (remnants of a tropical storm.) Roosts were growing during the 45 minutes we were there observing. Largest one was approximately 200. A footpath extends from the south end of this parking lot following the same row of trees along the western edge of the isthmus that is Pelee.  I travelled down it about 100m or so and was not able to locate any roosts in this area. Curiously they chose the trees adjacent to the asphalt road that runs the length of West Beach.  Winds were increasing as we left the park at closing (sunset.) Branches were being blown down and we were hoping they would hang on.

There were approximately 1,000 Monarchs on 2 branches on the leeward side of the gusting easterly wind and rain. The road is on a bluff with farm fields to the east. There are some trees along the bluff and these Monarchs were hunkered down in a smaller tree/bush just out of arm's reach. See separate report for what we found at Point Pelee. Amazing.

161484,1526365899,2018-09-09,Monarch Fall Roost,100000,41.636,-83.215,"I saw several dozen roosts yesterday, 9/9/2018 at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge along the SW shoreline of Lake Erie.  We were in the midst of a nor'easter so the Monarchs that had flown over Lake Erie had no choice but to roost. There were many independent roosts, but outstanding were the wooded stretches along the dike roads that held mega roosts with strands of smaller roosts that continued for many yards. 6 different dike roads were involved.  I estimated at least 2 million Monarchs. It was a phenomenal day.  I was at the refuge the day before (Saturday 9/8/19), and saw NO roosts.  However, there were reports of some smaller ones.&nbsp; So, in 24 hours, the roosts went from some, (I think it read a count of 1,000 individuals or more) to the exponential numbers that I saw.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would guess there were 50 roosts (several dozen). &nbsp;I stopped counting the roosts after the first 12 and figured I was less than 1/3 the way through the refuge auto-tour. &nbsp;The bulk of the roosts were further north which was the last 2/3s of the tour. &nbsp;Roosts were spread out &amp; thin for the first 1/4 or 1/3 of the tour. &nbsp;(<a href=""https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526365899c.jpg""> See map.</a> Understand, the start of the auto-tour is at the southern edge off Route 2 and swings west/north/east back and forth thru the roads, then the final western stretch is basically just off the shoreline to the exit.) The <a href=""https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526365899b.jpg"">massive roosts</a> were at one point 100 ft (approx??) off the lakeshore that had pounding waves and 35mph+ sustained winds. All the monarchs were on the leeward side of the woods that sat between the road and the shoreline. &nbsp;A perfect scenario for them to find shelter immediately coming in off the lake. &nbsp;Weather notes for 9/9/2018:  2 pm-4:15 pm is when I saw them. &nbsp;63F 100% sky cover &nbsp; 4:15pm raining and I left at 4:30pm. &nbsp;Winds over the lake were at least NE 35mph sustained. &nbsp;Winds inside the refuge ranged from NE 10-25 mph depending on location. &nbsp;I believe the overnight temps were in the mid-high 50F s with rain in the am through 12pm.&nbsp;There are no nectar sources in that area of the refuge but along the southern refuge roads were <a href=""https://journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526365899d.jpg"">these sunflowers</a> - I do not know the common or Latin name. (The photo taken 9/8/18 along a southern road.)&nbsp; There were several large fields in full bloom waiting for them! &nbsp;Also, there was some goldenrod but not nearly as much as the sunflower.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have counted Butterflies for the OH Leps long term study program for over 14 years including Karner Blues and just this year, the Dakota Skipper in MN, for The Nature Conservancy as a volunteer so I knew on Sunday I needed to photo &amp; write down as much as I could before it escaped me.&nbsp; I took over 400 photos in those 2 hours, wonder if any of those monarchs have a tag on them?&nbsp; Finding Waldo?&nbsp; More so, Tuesday (yesterday, 9/11/18), we had mostly sunny skies and 74F dry. &nbsp;No doubt the monarchs found their way to the nectar fields not long after taking flight in the morning after warming. &nbsp;I have over 400 photos and posted 50 on Flickr.

But they are reporting seeing thousands of monarchs this past weekend on their Facebook page.  ""Innumerable monarchs"" showed up on West Beach on 9-8-18, staying 3 days before leaving their roosts.  Here are some comments from their Facebook posts:""On September 6th the wind finally shifted to the north and we started to see some new migrants. Thirty-one birds of 10 species were banded and a total of fifty species was recorded. There were quite a few Swainson&rsquo;s Thrushes and Yellow-bellied Flycatchers in the netting area and a late Yellow Warbler was observed among a group of warblers on the census. Migratory Bald Eagles are coming through the area too.On September 7th we heard numerous flight calls of thrushes flying over when we got out of the car at Fish Point. We banded 86 birds of 17 species (41.25 net hours) including the fall&rsquo;s first Gray-cheeked Thrush and Purple Finch. A total of 66 species were recorded including 17 warbler species, a Swamp Sparrow, and a Hudsonian Godwit during the standard count period.The wind got stronger and gusted up to 20 knots today, September 8th. We opened nets for a couple of hours and observed some Gray-cheeked and other thrushes, but decided not to bother the birds under the bad weather conditions. Trees were squeaking above us everywhere. Census was done as usual, but more than that, there were innumerable Monarchs in the sky and tree branches at the west beach! At the same time there were millions of stable flies at the tip and they started circling around me on my way back.(photo: Monarch Butterfly)https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1742826595815268&amp;id=334082646689677Also a post stating: ""We banded 93 birds of 14 species this morning including 35 Swainson&rsquo;s and six Gray-cheeked Thrushes - 2.4 birds/net hour! There were lots of Red-breasted Nuthatches, Black-throated Blue Warblers and Ovenbirds. A Wilson&rsquo;s and a Western Palm Warbler were new for the season. A total of 57 species were recorded during the standard count period. For the last two days we couldn&rsquo;t open nets, but the census was done and 36 species were recorded, including 10 warbler species, on the 8th and a total 47 species, including 11 warbler species, on the 9th. The thousands of Monarchs waited almost three days for better wind conditions at Fish Point. They finally started flying around and going up high once the sun showed up. Lots of them were moving over the lake. I didn&rsquo;t see any dead Monarchs from the bad weather on my census during these three days, which reminded me how important the mature forest can be for sheltering many different creatures during bad weather conditions. Good luck to the Monarchs!

I went to the house to grab my binoculars to attempt to identify the birds.  I thought I was seeing leaves blowing through my binoculars. I was seeing literally thousands of monarchs riding the winds of a cold front moving through. The majority were gliding in the wind, expending little to no energy. Coming from the northeast to a southwest direction. It&rsquo;s 5:00 p.m. and some seem to be coming to the ground as I write this.  We shall see if they roost here tonight. This is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen!!!!I'm estimating I have been watching for over an hour. My estimate is nowhere scientific. Everywhere I looked with my binoculars, I could see monarchs....not one here and one there, 3-12 in my binocular focal point. Continuous. I live on a high hill, with 360 view. I literally thought they were leaves blowing.No pics of the monarchs. That would be impossible because 99.9% were not able to be seen with the naked eye. They were very much aloft. But somewhere this evening southwest of me, there will be an amazing roost!What prompted me to go into the house for my binoculars where hundreds of swallows that were dive bombing my freshly mowed alfalfa. There were many turkey buzzards and unknown raptors aloft which I assume were following the swallows.The sky was partially cloudy, with clouds that are on the leading edge of a storm. I'm estimating the wind to be 13 mph from the northeast with gusts to 20 mph.This sighting for me was a very enlightening experience. I learned that monarchs and birds will utilize the leading edge of a front to boost them for many miles - speeding travel and conserving energy.Editor's Note: The observer&rsquo;s effort to estimate the number of monarchs in a one-hour continuous flow seems reasonable. The 10,000 per hour estimate would break down to roughly 3 monarchs per second. Here&rsquo;s the math: 3 monarchs/second X 60 seconds/minute X 60 minutes/hour = 10,800 monarchs per hour.

Monarchs were everywhere in the strips and were gathering in the trees along the edge of the field...and in the saplings scattered throughout the plot. Getting ready to roost for the night. Fantastic! Our monarch count is an estimate. My friend said "" thousands"", but I was going to say 500-1000. They were everywhere! Made me so happy ...and it was rewarding, to see that my efforts in converting a fallow field to native prairie, were attracting and feeding these beauties! Prior to the native planting, we were stunned to see our old oak tree covered with monarchs one evening ...at first I thought the leaves had all turned brown.  As we got closer, it was just breathtaking. I was hooked! Hoped each year to catch it again, but with our timing or their flight pattern, we haven't had a repeat.

Just before 14:00 we started to notice them flying in a definite Southwest direction. They seemed to be descending as they approached the marsh/wetland abutting Lake Erie. We observed them from the Hawk Tower using both our binoculars and the naked eye. They were flying singly at altitudes varying from two to three times tree height to just above the ground.   Using the binoculars we were able to observe that as they approached the lake's edge they seemed to hesitate and then disappear behind a mature Cottonwood on private property flying further west.  Around 15:15 we decided to head to the lake to see if we could see where they were headed. Some were crossing the lake! Using the binoculars I could see them flying Southwest into the wind flapping their wings constantly about a metre above the waves. In a ten minute period I saw 10 singles and one pair crossing and one heading back.   I watched until they disappeared out of my field of vision.

From our vantage point at 1,200 feet (in the five acre wooded meadow/pasture/garden I cleared in our 65-acre forest property), the Monarch fall migration pattern funnels between these two mountain ranges in the areas known locally as Blackwells Hollow and, further south, Brown's Cove.The peak migration Carmen and I observed on the afternoon of September 25 occurred as the weather finally cleared, right after days of rain, when (I assumed) Monarchs left their roosts en masse on their flight south.Carmen pointed out to me dozens that were flying so high, I would not otherwise have noticed them.

A windy cold front came through and so did a bunch of monarchs at high altitude with a few gliding lower. One folded its wings, dropped like a rock then double-backed to check out the flowers in the yard. While this was going on, I got 2 such visitors.In a nutshell, what happened during the course of the day is that a few monarchs had shown up to nectar in the morning and then seemed to have disappeared completely the nearer to noon it got. The wind started to pick up from the north about mid-afternoon, 3pm-ish, and that's when I started to monitor the skies overhead (I first witnessed this type of event last year and my hunch was based on last year's experience). The ones I could spot came at a rate of about 1 every couple minutes, but that accelerated to one every minute, and at peak it was one every 45 seconds-ish and their rate of travel had accelerated to the point of being too quick to allow my camera to focus. ""Flying as fast as the wind"" would be a literal accurate description. The number of minutes I watched were non-contiguous and I didn't keep track of exactly how many those were. I watched on and off from mid-afternoon til dusk, something like 7 or 7:30-ish pm.In the afternoon, after watching long enough to develop a bit of a crick in my neck, I went to my computer and posted notice of the event in progress in a Facebook Group called Oklahoma Friends of Monarchs, where reports elsewhere in Oklahoma of this event were posted and the Admin urged everyone to report those sightings to Journey North and I'm sure they did just that. It's worthwhile to mention again that the meteorologist at OKC TV station KFOR showed radar that detected the front which is supposed to detect just precipitation and he explained that the radar image wasn't precipitation but ""birds and bugs"". It's reasonable to infer that the monarch migration event did show up on weather radar. :)This picture is of the nectaring area in the front yard the morning of the same day the event occurred.",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/09/1526373755.jpg,2018-09-25,2018,9,September,39

Larger clusters of 20 or so, started to develop in the upper and interior sections of an old oak tree. (Up too high to get a good photo....where can I post a movie?)As each new butterfly touched down in a cluster, it set off a chain reaction of wings flashing orange, opening and closing, picking up the color of the sunset. With wings closed, the clusters almost disappeared. This was the smallest group so far. Estimating 300.At 7:30 a.m. the next morning,they were still roosting. Ten minutes later, they took to the sky.

It was very difficult to estimate the number of monarchs in the field since they were moving around and the field was very tall. Based on scanning the field and the number we tagged I would say 250-300+ and that is very conservative and likely much higher than that. Most of those monarchs headed to the roost.

166912,1526376887,2018-09-30,Monarch PEAK Migration,31,41.638,-70.904,"Hello all: The last three days here have seen the most visible monarch migration activity I have seen this year. One&rsquo;s and two&rsquo;s in a few small waves only, up til this past weekend where I had 11 monarchs drop in late in the day yesterday to nectar on the flowering asters and goldenrods in my yard (Waystation 04511). Four monarchs in my yard again as early as 8 am and more through out the day - three or four staying through the cloudy afternoon and the last one just leaving just as rain began for what I think must be a roosting area (heading northeast back to the forest and away from my yard) in the face of a strong south west wind. For the last three days monarchs have been coming early in the morning and leaving after an hour or so in a southwest direction - slipping up and over my neighbors house. Still others drop in throughout the day and stay until 5:30 and fly back in two the northeast.Today, while doing a botanical inventory in saltmarsh, and maritime shrub communities on West Island, I counted 22 monarchs in one hour nectaring on seaside goldenrod. Most were in the upper saltmarsh on the lee side of the wind but a few were on low plants out in the wind and hanging on. Interestingly, some the asters and goldenrods are either late to flower this year or staying in flower later. Not sure which. Usually I observe higher monarch numbers earlier, but often the New England asters (their asters of choice!) have gone by before the main wave of monarchs come by. This year NE asters are still in bloom at my way station in great profusion and there are still several other asters just beginning to flower.Also the seaside goldenrod is in full and early bloom here on October 1 - did everything flower late because of the drought? I don&rsquo;t know.The weather in September changed dramatically from hot (early) to cool and cloudy and I didn&rsquo;t observe any monarchs moving for days at a stretch. The last three days were sunny (if windy) and we have more warm temps promised for the end of the week after two days of rain. Hope the migration continues then. I do enjoy seeing the monarchs on the asters. You have to wait all year for goldenrods and asters to bloom but when they do they are much enjoyed by all sorts of insects and pollinators - especially the monarchs, who look like orange jewels hanging from the purple and yellow flowers.

Thousands and thousands of Monarchs filled the skies for a couple of hours before and after a front came through.  When the reports started being posted on our local FB group, it was storming and pouring at my house.  I made the decision to see if I could get away from the storm and catch the migration.  It&rsquo;s been hard hearing reports all around, including one report within 5 miles of my house, and not seeing anything!  I got in the car and drove west.  Within a few miles, I was out of the heavy downpour and the rain was falling lightly.  I started seeing Monarchs in front of me.  I pulled off the road and watched them.  I ended up driving down to Bixby which is a couple of miles south of where I was seeing the Monarchs, and ended up on a dead-end street.  The Monarchs were swirling above me and flying southwest.  There were hundreds.  I would calculate at least a thousand per minute.  They were flying overhead, they were descending and swirling, and they were everywhere! I stood there and watched them for 20 minutes with no breaks, just continuous monarchs coming overhead, some coming all the way down to the ground, and others as high as the eye could see.  It was truly amazing.  I estimate that there were more than 10,000 per hour crossing my location. There were Monarchs migrating across the entire metropolitan area of Tulsa, probably a 30 mile swath, and I saw a tiny fraction of them.  We have estimated hundreds of thousands flew over the area, possibly millions.

It has been the best Monarch year here that I can ever remember, as it has been in so many other places.  I planted 11 more swamp milkweed plants in my own garden this week in hopes of not running out of milkweed next year like I did this year.  Every person I know in our area who grows milkweed for Monarchs on suburban properties ran out of milkweed this year.  Let's hope the beauties can navigate all of this extreme weather safely on their journeys.  ",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2018/10/1526380808.jpg,2018-10-09,2018,10,October,41

I have not seen Monarchs this dense in Allen since 2005. It has been raining really hard for two days, with the sun finally emerging today. This morning, temps were in the low 60's, but by 2 pm this afternoon, they rose to the mid 70's with light winds.One concern: I noted that the ones I caught for tagging did not seem very fat. I fear that the bad weather has kept them from feeding for a few days.  Some also looked a bit travel-worn.Interestingly, my next stop (about two miles away) yielded exactly one Monarch. I went from the church garden to another garden designed as a Monarch Waystation. Unfortunately, some compromise substitutions had been made in the original plant list, and the garden looks great but isn't attracting nearly as many butterflies as the garden with the abundance of natives. The gardeners working with the second garden  will be adding more natives when they can. I watched one small butterfly land repeatedly on Zinnias with congested centers and give up without nectaring there. I had read that the more open forms have more readily accessible nectar, but this was the first time I have seen a living illustration of that principle.All-in-all, it was an amazing day to be a Monarch fan in Allen, TX.I would estimate there were between 500 and 1,000. There was too much movement to really count. Of the 25 that I tagged, I did not see any of them fly by again.",,2018-10-14,2018,10,October,41

I saw a few drift overhead.  A couple visited nearby Maximilian Sunflowers.  Warmest day in quite a while at 84 high. Around 1630 I walked around and checked the closest usual roost trees.  Flushed Monarchs from the outside of several Live Oaks and Ashe Junipers.  Also saw less than 5 more high overhead.  All the large roost friendly trees I checked had Monarchs.  I did not find many up inside trees or inside groves. Easily flushed.  Not in Groups.  None seeking nectar except the ones earlier.  Lots of Liatris in bloom and many other flower species. So getting ready to setrtle in but not there.   At the same times many other butterfly species were actively feeding.  Thousands of Queens (Danaus gilippus) many of the larger size common this late in the year.  Mostly feeding on King Ranch Bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum var. songarica) inflorescences (the grass version of flowers). King Ranch Bluestem is growing unusually well with all the rain this year.  Unfortunately it is a non-native invasive that is hard to control. Queens and Common buckeyes and a million small moths seemed to prefer it to the Liatris growing with it.  But I digress. I am writing this the day after. Forecast for 40 degree temp drop, rain and wind was accurate.  From 84 at 1645, dropped to 64 at 1900, reached 39 by 0700 this morning and has not been above 41 all day.  Several inches of rain and more to come.  Forecast to remain in 40s Tuesday and Wed. So Monarchs are not likely to go anywhere. Front was in Austin 0200 and San Antonio 0300.

Count of 76 including 4 sunset clusters of 2-4-6 &amp; 8 Monarchs! My photos captured mostly males (confirmed 1 female). Initially monarchs arrived from the north over the western shoreline on the west side of the Tip &amp; quickly zipped inland over west path &amp; continued south to interior trees or toward the Tip. A few stopped to nectar on Thistle &amp; in the small meadow on Bouncing Bet/Soapwort. About a 1/2 dz attempted to venture out south over the very calm east side but after entering open water &amp; encountering strong westerly wind they retreated back to the treeline. And the east side has some beach again so I was able to observe activity there. Numerous monarchs were flitting amongst the trees on east side &amp; interior trees as well. Mosquitoes were horrible! Upon returning to parking lot observed at about 8:11 pm clusters forming in Hackberry trees with branches cascading over Tip Shuttle stop (A common area for early Sept clusters) They were also on bare branches &amp; on cascading grapevine.

They were roosting in the trees. I found them about 11am. I went back in the evening around 7pm and most of them were already gone. Editor&rsquo;s note: We have contacted the observer to confirm details of this roost. Additional comments from observer: Date: Sunday 8-18-19 between 10:15am and 11:00 am. I did an estimate by counting the number of Monarchs on 1 extended branch and than counting the number of branches that were similarly full on the tree.  I then multiplied the amount by the number of trees that were occupied. I did not account for Monarchs that were flying overhead or outside the main roosting area. I am not sure about the nectar source. There is a decent amount of Milkweed along the dirt road leading to the wooded area. I think there is a field of beets on the Northern side. Temperatures: it was a chilly morning, around 55 degrees when I started my day and I was wearing a long sleeve shirt...but it warmed up just enough after I found the roost and it was over 60 degrees for sure. It was definitely cooler where they were at though and there had to be a 5 degree difference from the sunshine to this shaded area.

There was still many Monarchs on the grassland this evening and some were moving about in the roosting area. Still a lot of wildflowers to reach peak bloom such as Goldenrod, the Sunflowers, Meadow and Rough blazing star. I did see a mating pair this evening. The Monarchs I am seeing will likely move on soon but I think there will be another wave from our area due to some late mating and the availability of nectar plants.

It was probably 7:30 when I made that move, giving me about half an hour before the sun set.  The first tree was empty, but there were butterflies flying around some fruit trees in the yard and after about 5 minutes I spotted the cluster forming above me in a large maple.  Two clusters formed very close together (see photo).The nectar source was a long narrow field, perhaps 40 acres of unmown hay, but not much alfalfa.  I had spotted enough red clover there two days before to know that monarchs might use it for nectaring.Temps went from 70s to 60s while I was there, then ended up at about 50 degrees in the night.Wind was from the Northwest the first night (Wednesday, 8/21); Thursday it was mainly Northeast.  On Wednesday, the monarchs were on the southeast side of the maple, so the lee side, shielded.  Eventually it died down to near calm.  Thursday was less wind, mostly calm from 7 o&rsquo;clock until I left at 8:30.  Monarchs were sheltered in the small roost I saw at the north end of the red clover field.Most of the monarchs were gone since the night before.  I suspect 90% of them migrated with the north wind today.I did see one small roost of six and another of 12 so still had some fun.Writing this on 8/24........last night saw no Monarchs at that site, but did see one lone monarch in an alfalfa field to the south.  Conditions were perfect, but right now there are very few monarchs in this area.Our biggest hatch will come in the first week of September, as is usually the case.",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/08/1526416237.jpg,2019-08-22,2019,8,August,34

Most of the way down west path monarchs were observed flitting about and establishing roost spots on tree branches cascading over the path. 2-3 Monarchs in clusters &amp; many lone individuals settled on Hackberry &amp; Hop trees,  Grapevine &amp; bare branches. Quite a few torn/tattered/faded monarchs were observed this evening. A count of 45 over west path near the Tip; at sunset (8:19) another 10 near Tip parking lot came in from the north; about another 20 over Tip Shuttle stop were seen flitting about under &amp; over treetops.

I saw so many on our grassland several days ago I had a good feeling about seeing more roosts this season.It is looking like a good year around here for Monarch production.

Another half dozen butterflies were circling, leaving and coming back as dark approached.  I first saw roosts on the evening of August 30th - but that's because it was the first time I went looking.   The Dolan flats where this large tree is on the west side of the perimeter, is a swampy area that is full of pollinators all summer.  Right now the most visible nectar sources are Joe Pye weed and Goldenrod.Both evenings, there was almost no breeze.   The roosts are all on the East side of the tree where the sun will find it early in the day.Overnight temperatures were around 15 degrees Celcius both nights.  The branches are towards the inside of the tree so I'd guess that gave them maximum protection.I used binoculars to count the individuals - those already in the roost and those flying around.  It's a conservative estimate since I found 3 roosts very high up, so in all likelihood there were more than 50, most especially as it appeared there was a 4th roost that I couldn't see on the 31st but butterflies were flying around that location which was a bit more inside the tree, on it's south-west side.Today is a rainy day so I'm not expecting to see much.",,2019-08-30,2019,8,August,35

I was at the point were you enter the Bay across from Phillip Edward Island and there were easily 50-100 + Monarchs an hour. They were positioned really high and at ground level. Moving in pods of 1-12 with 5-10 seconds between pods. IT was beautiful. IN 52 years of hiking I have never seen anything like it. Some where soaring on currents of air as the day was brisk and windy. I have never seen butterfly's soar on wind currents. It was magical.Andi~,,2019-09-01,2019,9,September,35

Last night, though, we got out the binoculars to count them to double check.The roosts we&rsquo;ve seen start happening around 7 pm Eastern. The first one I noticed was on Friday, August 30th. That was the first day I looked for them, though, so they may have been here longer. We have noticed them off and on for years but no one was watching consistently for the past ten years because the house we now live in was previously sitting empty. They have been there every day since the 30th in varying numbers. The most we saw was on the day we counted 100 or so. There were multiple roosts that evening. Last night (9/5), there weren&rsquo;t nearly as many. The farm where we live is pretty overgrown with clover, thistle and some milkweed so they have plenty of places to feed.

Roosts were noted in six separate very mature trees (Pine, 2 Spruce, Mulberry, Apple and Oak) on the north side of each tree except the Oak which had a dozen on its west side . In the Pine, Spruce and Oak all the roosts were relatively low on the tree.  In the Apple and Mullberry the roosts were near the top.   The largest and most tightly clustered roost was in the Mulberry tree which was also the furthest south (300.)  173 in the Pine, 150 in the Apple.  Temperature was 19°C according to my dashboard.  No clouds. No notable wind. It had been a beautiful sunshiny day in Essex County. Forecast low of 12 with a dew point of 13. This grove of trees has an abundance of goldenrod just beginning to bloom should they need nectar in the morning. Counting was done visually cluster by cluster using my binoculars and calling out the counts to my son who had the calculator.  A family who was on the way back from a journey to Point Pelee to see Monarchs noticed us and the Monarchs and stopped to take some photos. We shared our observations with them and they were quite pleased, as were we.    ",,2019-09-05,2019,9,September,36

Our yards are small and houses packed quite close together.  However, all of my neighbors are receiving the overflow and starting to plant Monarch-friendly nectaring patches.  A few are starting to inquire about my milk weed pods to take home and plant, or take to their parents farmland and plant.  I may only have 20 Monarchs at my patch at a time, but I will see dozens hovering up and down the back alley used for garages.  We are also attracting many black, and yellow Swallowtails, as well as whatever the little guys are that commute about a thousand feet in large clouds. Yes, we consider ourselves PEAK.  At night they roost in our very large back yard tree.BTW, many of my neighbors are also asking me how to start a Way Station.  We may be small, but we are mighty!  My husband is a manager at the St. Louis Science Center, which now has a &ldquo;Grow&rdquo; exhibit.  Also, the Missouri Botanical Garden has a Way Station, not too many miles from us.

The overnight temps were probably around 60f.

Looked up around 09:00 and started noticing Monarchs in directional flight Southwest coming across the harbour at heights from head height to tree top and above.  Rate was one per minute approximately. About an hour after the boats launched we headed to the Burlington side of the harbour to the Lasalle Park and Marina for a better view of the regatta on shore and I still noted Monarchs at the rate of one per minute. Flying height again varying from head height at harbour level to some flying above tree top level on the bluff above the harbour. Noticed three nectaring on flowers in the Lasalle Park on the bluff but all the rest were on the move.  A friend who was in the harbour on the race committee boat for the regatta noted many monarchs flying past him  in the middle of the harbour throughout the race.  Dinghys came in off the harbour around 16:30 and that is the last observation I made as I was busy hauling boats after that.  Using these observations I feel confident to note a migration rate through this area at one per minute minimum from 09:00 until 16:30 For a conservative total of 450.It was a beautiful late summer day, partly cloudy with temperatures ranging from approximately 17°C to 22°C.  Wind was variable at times but  according to the AccuWeather function on my phone  292.5° at 18 km/h at 16:15. The Monarchs were undeterred by the wind and at times seemed to be flying directly into it.  Counting was done by texting myself each time I saw one or more and by noting the time in the vehicle while driving. What a beautiful sight to witness.

I hoped the weather might make monarchs take cover on the island. But as it warmed up, I became more doubtful.We headed over to Gibraltar island to visit Cooke's Castle and Stone Lab. Monarchs were sailing over the water, and we watched them fly across the island at tree top level in a southwest direction. We saw 9 monarchs on the 6-acre island in 2 hours time.

They were scattered in clusters of 2-4 dozen all along the drive, mostly in the hackberry trees about 15-25 feet up.I spotted a tagged monarch, but my aging Rebel camera managed only blurry pictures in the low light. I handed Maya my Nikon Coolpix, and begged her to try to get a photo of the tag code--she has far better eyesight than me. She did it!  A couple riding their bikes came over, and we recruited them to help. Robert is a birder, and he ran to get his binoculars from his car parked at the ferry. He and Daven found another tagged monarch, but we couldn't make out the code.Nevertheless, it was quite fun! We met some new monarch friends, Robert and Eileen, and got one tag code. It may be months before we find out where the monarch was tagged, but I hope we find out sooner! I never tire of chasing monarchs.",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/09/1526421510.jpg,2019-09-07,2019,9,September,36

The wind was from the north and the butterflies were gone the next day.Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingI have been checking the grove of trees for several days.  I check in the morning about 9, again around noon and later in the afternoon usually between 3 and 4.  Last Thursday (9/5/19) I had done the first 2 checks and seen 5 or 6 Monarchs.  When I checked at 3, it was immediately obvious that there were more.  The Monarchs roost on the north and south side of a grove of walnut, ash, choke cherry trees with evergreen trees and dogwood shrubs in the interior of the grove.  Thursday afternoon I skirted the perimeter.  There were several large clumps of Monarchs.  I counted 2 of the clumps at 28 and probably 36 (due to some taking flight, it had to be a guess)  I multiplied the number of clumps I had seen by 25 and reported at least 150.  The overnight temperatures were in the 50s.  I am never sure about the Monarch's choice of roosting sites.  Because there are many trees and micro-climes among and between the trees, it is hard to say, but I often find them on the south side of the trees, but the perimeter and the roost would be described on the north side.  There is a soybean field directly to the north and the Monarchs come from the north above the soybeans so the trees are the first they encounter.  If we have a south wind while they are here, they flutter about, sometimes nectaring on Black-eyed Susan blooms, sedum, phlox.  But they roost much more frequently than they nectar.

Ones and twos at first and then the sky was full. Between 14:45 and 15:00 I counted one thousand.  Sadly the regatta had ended and I need to leave to go help remove boats back in Hamilton.  I would have loved to stay to count more. There were more monarchs in the sky than this but this was all I could count in the view from my binoculars. However if I moved the binocular view around there were monarchs filling the sky at high altitudes.  Most monarchs were visible only with the binoculars. High of 19°C low of 17°C.  Did not take note of the wind direction on my device but it appeared to be generally Southwest and moderate.  In conversation with these gentlemen they shared with me that they had seen monarchs here the last couple of years but they had gone away for a number of prior to that but that historically you would see many travelling through this area each autumn.

This butterfly swarm continued for about three hours in the morning and tapered off to 350 per hour in the afternoon. Weather conditions ideal - sunny, 65- 70 F with little to no wind. Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingOn Sunday Sept 8, for a 2 hour period from 10:00 AM until noon hour a river of orange snaked along and high above the bluffs overlooking Lake Erie at Clearville Park. I have a trailer at that location with a roof top viewing deck. All butterflies move in southwest direction and parallel to the lake shore. The bluffs are 80 feet above the water surface. The butterflies were in the air column above the bluffs with many butterflies so high they where just specks.  I confirmed they were monarchs through binoculars. This is caused by light winds from the west that blow the butterflies up against the lake. The butterflies have no need to go over the water here because their destination is Pt Pelee 60 miles to the south-west which offers the shortest distance over the lake to Ohio. Their direction of travel exactly parallels the lake which also just happens to be the direction they need to go to get to Mexico.  The lake shore acts like a funnel. I noticed that there were also  high numbers observed along the east shore of Lake Michigan and also on Lake Erie further to the north-east from my location.  When weather conditions are right I have overserved this funnelling of butterflies along the lake in previous years migrations. These conditions didn&rsquo;t last long because once the on-shore breeze starts up the butterflies disperse over a wider area so the numbers observed drop.  This same phenomenon occurs for migrating green-darner dragonflies at Clearville Park. They all of a sudden appear by the 10s of thousands. Its quite a site.  Green-darners migrate to the gulf coast of the US and Mexico.    The 15000 is my best hourly estimate. For two 10 minute periods I count as many as I can see and if I see a huge clump of them I estimate how many are in the clump. I compare the totals for each period and continue observing throughout the hour to see if the rate changes. I then used this information to estimate hourly totals.  When the on-shore breezes picked up the numbers of butterflies dropped to the lower values and this continued for several hours in the afternoon. The following two days the wind conditions changed again and butterflies observed drop to 25 per hour or less.  ",,2019-09-08,2019,9,September,36

Dozens of monarchs continually flying in with roosts building throughout the evening.Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingThe evening of September 7th we went to the tip of Point Pelee NationalPark. There was a strong westerly wind blowing. We only found a small roost of maybe 50 monarchs in two trees. We did not venture further because a park volunteer told us they had reports of large roosts at Seacliff Park. We headed to Seacliff, but it was almost dark. Once there we spotted about 300 monarchs roosting on the lower branches in 4 trees, I am sure there were many more, but it was too dark to see, especially the higher branches. Winds were WNW 15km/hr, overnight low 15C.We returned to Seacliff Park on the evening of September 8th.  I started looking for roosts at 6:15pm. They were concentrated in about 4 trees. If the roosts were small, I counted individual monarchs. Larger roosts, I would count out roughly 20 and then estimate how many sections of this size were in the roost. My husband was doing the same thing.I believe our counts were conservative. There were many individual monarchs scattered about that did not get counted, nor the ones flying around. This is the evening we reported 550 monarchs.On September 8th the wind was NE 15km/hr. All of the roosts were on the south side of the trees, sheilded from the wind. These are very large, mature oaks and maples.The nighttime low was 15C.There are no nectar plants directly in the park. The Leamington marina area has gardens a few km to the east, but I am unsure of what flowers there are in those beds.I cannot confirm when the roost first formed, it was already there on the 7th and even earlier than that according to the park volunteer.

I'm not sure what time they first noticed the Monarchs. Someone said ""they were not here yesterday"". I did not get to Headlands Dunes until about noon, then went back from 5 to 8 pm. This is historically a pretty good place for Monarchs to come across Lake Erie. One of the Monarchs I tagged at Headlands Dunes on August 31, 2007, was recovered in El Rosario. The truly amazing thing (I think) is that I know of two other people who were also tagging Monarchs at the Dunes that same day, although we didn't run into each other. All three of us had a Monarch that we tagged that day at the Dunes recovered in El Rosario!To estimate the number of adults, I counted 22 flying, there were 2 or 3 groups in trees of about 30 or 40 Monarchs each that I could see. (I forgot my binoculars the first time I went.)  There were about 30 nectaring on goldenrod and white snakeroot. There were also smaller groups in trees and shrubs -- 2 or 3 up to 10 on bare branches. I also saw people taking pictures of other trees.The overnight temperatures on Friday were in the mid-50's. Saturday morning was cool and overcast. The sun peaked in and out and came out in the afternoon. Other people told me the Monarchs were gone on Sunday.There was a pretty good breeze from the South or South Southwest early on Saturday. I wish I would have written down the weather conditions. I remember checking the weather and thinking the Monarchs might stay for a day or two if the wind continued stray out of the South. The monarchs were shielded from the wind in this location.

The weather was initially overcast and very cool, but monarchs were migrating nonetheless. In fact, this is the strongest monarch migration day I have witnessed in many, many years. In this area, the shoreline drops cliff-like down to Lake Ontario, and this shoreline contained vast amounts of goldenrod, New England aster, but also many butterfly nectar plants planted by a local group. The monarchs streamed westward, and on some occasions, I could see over 100 monarchs at once in my view. Monarchs were arriving from the north and also from the east, possibly spurred on by the approaching cold front. It is impossible to determine how many monarchs passed this site this day, but 500,000 would not be an exaggeration. The number could have been larger. Slightly west, a dried up pond filled with cattails had sloping bank that were totally covered with yellow goldenrod. In the afternoon, I estimated that this yellow carpet had about 10,000 monarchs nectaring here. As for the tagging event, 200 attended and in less than 2 hours, 500 tags were used up.

We stopped to look at a passing hawk, and realized the sky above us was also full of migrating butterflies.  You would move the focus dial on your binoculars and see layers and layers of migrating butterflies; hundreds of them, as far up as you could see.  Almost all were moving slowly but deliberately N or NW toward the Lake Ontario shoreline west of the peninsula.

Sept. 9 to Sept. 16. They are always in my view,  5 to 7 at a time.  The neighbours noticed them roosting about 6 pm on Sept . 11th, 2019.  I went down our street (about 500 feet off the  beach) about 7 pm.  It was about 75 &lsquo; F.  I watched them streaming inland for about an hour till it was dark and they were still coming in and landing on maple trees and pine trees filling the branches.  As they landed they would cause a few butterflies to shift position and flutter around the branches before settling down again.  They were still resting on the tree branches in the morning before 8 am.  100&rsquo;s of butterflies were in each tree.  There were about 7 or 8 trees covered with the monarchs.  So I guessed 1000. Since I reset my outdoor thermometer each morning, the night time low this week was about 58&rsquo;F and the day time high was about 78&rsquo;F. The lake was fairly calm and the wind was out of the north. Many were feeding on fall flowers in my yard and neighbouring yards.  It was not unusual to see 8 to 10 at a time in my yard any time of the day and/or flying south down the street from the beach. Nectar sources were scarce near the beach/roost trees and that is likely why they were visiting the neighbours yards this week ...150 to 600 feet off the beach.The trees the monarch choose to roost in each night were about 200 feet off the beach. There were 2 or 3 rows of trees and row of houses between their roost trees and the beach. They would have some shelter from the wind.  The wind was not very strong from the north either night.This was an amazing event.  The last time I saw something like this was with 1971 or 1972 about the 19th of Sept.

190630,1526423747,2019-09-13,Monarch PEAK Migration,95,42.183,-82.804,"Over the past four days I have observed an interesting phenomena, one that I may have been overlooking for years. On Tuesday upon exiting Essex Public School after dropping off milkweed leaves for the grade ones, two monarchs flew right in front of my face.  On my way to the car I kept noticing more. So I commenced a count for approximately one hour. I noted one per minute on average flying directly towards the school and either around or up and over the roof. Then on my drive home I was noting one per minute as well. I counted by texting myself each time that I saw a Monarch. Wednesday and Thursday the same thing happened. On Thursday I took a drive in a north-east direction from the school and travelled up and down some nearby concession roads that run north/south. I was again noting one monarch per minute with the naked eye for another hour. Many were flying at about the height of half a hydro pole right down to ground level. I noted three struck by vehicles. Every autumn my son has always remarked in his seven years attending Essex Public School that during recess the kids see monarchs. The past couple years that I have been helping in the grade one classes the children have approached me to say they are seeing monarchs in the schoolyard. I may have been overlooking for years the significance of these numbers. Today, it happened again, more monarchs upon exiting the school. So I counted on my drive home out of town and along North Talbot Road at least one per minute. After putting in a load of laundry I  went back up the road and stopped at the corner of North Talbot and Essex County Road 23. I sat there for 40 minutes and counted 95. This is an average of two per minute. Would that I could have sat there all day. So amazing.  Partly sunny, winds were 135°at 14 km/h and the temperature was 22°C according to the weather function on my mobile phone, when I made my observations today.  Most were flying between vehicle height, up to hydro pole height. All well below the windmills. I am hypothesising that this is an annual migration pathway. Perhaps as they round Lake St. Clair and head southwest is what brings them through the heart of Essex County?",,2019-09-13,2019,9,September,37

They started filtering in around 5:00 p.m. with peak numbers showing up around 6:30 p.m. Estimate at least 300, but groups are scattered amongst the many evergreens so totals are hard to tell. GREAT to have them back for a nightly visit and looking forward to tomorrow night to see if numbers hold.Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sighting1. The first large roost formed on Monday, September 16th.2. The Monarchs who congregated on Monday night were quick to roost in groups. We live on one acre of land and it is almost entirely covered by either deciduous or evergreen trees. We noticed last year during the roost that the Monarchs have a couple of 'favorite' places so we always began our searches there once we saw them filtering in. Large clumps were easy to spot so we did actual counts of their size. This would routinely be around 20 -30 members. We would then take note of smaller groups and single visitors and roughly add those numbers in. The reason I mention about the number of trees we have is because there is so much canopy to survey that I know we are underestimating numbers. It's just too tricky in the evening twilight to see them all. We always get out early the next morning to see if there were any groups that we overlooked the night before. So numbers based on actual counts plus a small estimate of stragglers.3. I am happy to report that our yard is slowly becoming one big nectar source. I have dedicated about 1/4 of my yard to a naturalized flower area that contains milkweed, coneflower, rudbeckia, daisy, salvia, Russian sage, goldenrod, phlox, and soon to have liatris. Also, while we are surrounded on three sides by farm fields, there is a drainage ditch running along the fourth and it's banks are filled with all sorts of indigenous plants (as well as being a calm water source).4. Our yard is located in a floodplain so overnight temperatures are always a degree or two cooler than surrounding areas. Monday night got down to 60 degrees F, with lows the rest of this week ranging from 57 to 63 degrees F.5. On Monday night the breeze was light and from the ENE at around 5 mph. The light to calm wind conditions have continued through the week and have ranged from calm to maybe 5 mph around the time the Monarchs settle in. Daytime breezes were a bit higher, but never exceeding 7 - 10 mph. Wind direction has been from the east, to briefly from the south and east, to almost calm last night. The yard is completely sheltered from the wind with the north and west sides ringed with large arborvitae, white pine and Norway spruce. The east side is home to a large silver maple, a large bald cypress and a hackberry tree. Crabapple and Cleveland pear trees run along the south with assorted others throughout the yard. Late arrivals seem to prefer the maple and cypress on the east side of the yard, while the typical favorite spot is tucked into the northwest corner where the arbs and spruces come together. Less roosting in the evergreens this year as a whole and more in the deciduous trees; especially the silver maples.",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/09/1526425133.jpg,2019-09-16,2019,9,September,38

The sighting was documented and 6 butterflies we tagged by Kylee Baumle 9/17/19. Image courtesy of Kylee BaumleEditor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingI can definitely verify that they were roosting here on August 29th. The picture is of the tail end of a swarm of butterflies I saw while I was mowing by the trees. It was taken on August 29th. At that time I would guess there were hundreds in that area of my yard. I never really checked the other side of my yard so I couldn&rsquo;t tell you if they were roosting there also at that time. It seems like they are staying close to mostly mine and my close neighbors' trees. The neighbors a little down the road had no idea they were here because the seem to stay in this area. I had Kylee estimate the number of butterflies because she&rsquo;s more of an expert than me. All of mine and my neighbors' trees are absolutely full of them. When she came back for a second visit we both questioned the original estimate of 5,000 that I gave you because we went out at sunrise and the amount seemed more. We decided each tree had at least hundreds in them and a few had to have had at least a thousand. We have a little over 20 trees on both properties. She said she has never seen anything like it outside of Mexico. Except for in Mexico you can&rsquo;t see the branches at all. Overnight temps recently have been in the mid 60&rsquo;s. They seem to roost on the North and West sides of the trees that I&rsquo;ve noticed.

The picture is dark, but if you zoom in, you can see about 10 monarchs. Prettiest thing ever!Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingI don't know when the roost first formed.  It's on a part of our property that I don't frequent. I was out mowing ... about 11:30 am ... I rounded the corner behind our neighbor's fence and started mowing along the treeline.  Suddenly, a swarm of monarchs flew up.  I steered away from the thicket immediately and shut off the mower. I called for my daughter - she ran out to me, thinking I was hurt, but when she saw the butterflies, she gasped. I visited the site (about 50 yards behind our house) several times over the next few hours.  Through the day, the numbers dwindled as those trees received more sunlight.  By the time my husband got home at about 4:30 pm, almost all of them were gone.  He was sad he hadn't seen it.Standing in one place, looking at the most narrow portion of the thicket (about 20' x 30'), I counted well over 100.  That was just counting the ones I could actually see clearly.  There were more on the other side of the thicket, but I wasn't sure which were monarchs and which were dead leaves on limbs that had fallen.  The thicket between the fields runs for probably two football lengths, and I saw fluttering the whole way down. I think 500 was a very conservative estimate.Nectar sources nearby? The field to the west of the thicket is full of clover and alfalfa. The field to the east is fallow this year, but it's full of wild asters, clover, and a few other wildflowers.  There is a walnut grove also just to the left of the thicket that is full of goldenrod.  There are many houses around that have lots of zinnias and other flowers blooming.Overnight temps probably around 67F. Winds SSW. We live in a county with over 2000 people and 511 windmills. It is ALWAYS windy here. The monarchs were somewhat shielded from the wind.  The thicket runs north/south.  The butterflies didn't start clustering until about 10-15 feet into the thicket.

Tagged 100 in short orderEditor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingIt has been a wonderful season for monarchs!  I have tagged them the last four years, usually going out on 4+ occasions and lucky if I get 60 tags completed.  This year it took me 3 short visits to tag 100 and I could've done lots more.When did the roost first form? I visited the Badger Prairie park on 9/11 around 3pm and saw several hundred flying and feeding on goldenrod (tagged 25 in less than an hour). I did not witness the roost that day.  On 9/13 there was a post on Facebook from a gentleman that said hundreds were roosting at the park at 5pm.  Hi Temp that day was 70F, evening low 57F.  The only evening I witnessed the roost was 9/15, it was muggy and calm, temps were 74F, evening 64F.  I returned to the park on 9/17 and the goldenrod was past peak and I didn't see many monarchs, far fewer than 2 days prior.  How did you estimate 1000? There were at least 10 clumps of monarchs, each clump with at least 100.  When guessing again, I would say there could've been 3000.  The trees were filled with monarchs and this was just one area of the park ( Badger Prairie park is about 300 acres).  We witnessed the roost around 6:45 pm, after sunset, when it was getting pretty dark so it was pretty difficult to see how many were in the trees.  Also, the gentleman (from the Facebook post) saw the monarchs at a different part of the park, if they were there as well, then this park probably had 4000! The roost I saw was in a treeline at the southern end of the park, winds were SW at 5mph  (data taken from weather underground).  The treeline is not very protected but not very high up either. See video below. One other thing: On 9/20, as I was supervising the playground about 1 mile from Badger Prairie park, we saw a pretty constant stream of monarchs heading south - in an hour we saw 35 monarchs (the kids loved it).

They said they've been there for three days (heavy rainstorms with some sun). Mostly gone as of 9/20/19.Editor's note: contacted observer for more details on this sightingThe monarchs were roosting in my friend's neighbor's yard starting on Tuesday, Sept. 17th. She saw monarchs flying around on the 16th but the roost was discovered on the 17th in the afternoon. I observed the roost on Thursday, Sept. 19th (the photo submitted with this report was taken that day). They roosted in those trees until Sunday, Sept. 22nd according to my friend. As far as number estimation on my Sept 19th observation, there are 3 or 4 conifers in her back yard, each about 50 feet tall, with 2 or 3 branches per tree covered with monarchs. So if there were 200-250 butterflies per tree, that would be between 600 and 1000 butterflies. However, my friend reports that her observation on the evening of the 17th had probably twice the number of monarchs that I saw on the afternoon of 19th, with many on lower hanging branches. Interestingly, there were other types of conifers immediately adjacent to the roost but no monarchs on those...they clearly preferred this particular type of conifer! We observed one mating pair on Sept 19th afternoon as well. We aren't aware of nectar sources nearby however this is a residential neighborhood with lots of flower gardens. I personally have a small pollinator garden in my yard, 1/4 mile away, but only saw an occasional monarch floating through my yard.Here are overnight low temps and 24H max wind speeds. The wind direction was generally SE on most of these days, lots of rain, and yes, the trees and houses provided protection from the wind.Sept 17 (all early mornings temps): 69F/17mphSept 18: 69F/17mphSept 19: 70F/15mphSept 20: 67F/15mphSept 21: 73F/20mphSept 22: 66F/ 16mph After sharing my photos on FB, a friend mentioned that on Sept 8, they released 1,000 monarchs for a hospice fundraiser probably 3 or 4 miles away. Not sure if they were tagged monarchs but we didn't see any tags (not that we would necessarily know what what to look for). Finally, my friend's neighbor emailed these details about their departure on the 22nd: ""The butterfly departure was in full swing on Sunday afternoon following the rain.   They started by spreading their wings to dry out and then there were a few test flights.   By evening the butterflies were nearly all gone after the cooler temperatures and the light winds arrived.""

I couldn't even come close to counting all the monarchs traveling--hundreds and hundreds! Some were flying so high that murky, low clouds, hazy morning that I could barely spot them.&nbsp; I would have thought that they would fly low like ducks on cloudy hazy days.&nbsp; But they weren't.&nbsp; They were easily 200 feet up and higher.&nbsp; They were riding thermals in tight circles.&nbsp; Multiple ones in the same thermals.&nbsp; They were circulating in four-foot loops once the sun started to show a bit around 11:30 or so.&nbsp; Then once the clouds started to dissipate to a more mostly sunny scenario they started to not be as numerous by about noon. I could still always see waves of them.&nbsp; Sometimes they would all just start flying the other direction which I found humorous.&nbsp; But I continued to see them migrating all over west and north Toledo all day. Even out by my house on my drive home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mostly a few though as the afternoon went on.&nbsp; They would only fly the other direction once it was mostly sunny.Up untill about 11:30 they were all heading the same direction (southwest).If I ever see that many again in my life here in Toledo I will try to remember to call the news.&nbsp; Maybe their cameras work better. I honestly was seeing about 100 at a time.&nbsp; There was no way somebody could count them all because more and more would pass through.

I even zoomed in a bit which in hindsight I probably shouldn't have.Seeing all those monarchs was one of the most magical things I have ever witnessed.&nbsp; I honestly wouldn't doubt if 500,000-1,000,000 monarchs passed over the city limits.&nbsp; I'm not joking.&nbsp; That's my best guess.&nbsp; It was insane!!!!!It really makes me wonder how spectacular the migrations must have been many years ago.&nbsp; That must have been mind boggling.Note: Temps 70-74F, winds NNE at 4-7mph at the time of the sighting.",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/09/1526426913.jpg,2019-09-17,2019,9,September,38

Today Sept. 23 my yard and trees are full of floating, fluttering, and resting monarchs.

Within 1/2 mile I have 6 acres of CRP in mostly tall grass &amp; forbs, plus another 6 acres of 1-year-old pollinator planting.  I also have Mexican sunflowers and zinnias planted in my yard.

There is plenty of golden rod, prairie thistle, and Bergemont that I have observed there in the past, so much of it looks native species to Illinois. I am also ~2 miles away from a forest preserve and nature preserve as well (Buffalo Trace nature preserve and Lake of the Woods forest preserve), both of which are actively being restored to natural prairie.

How did you estimate the number of adults?  That is just a wild guess.   Ha...    There were way too many to count.   And if a person got to close to a tree, there would be a flurry of them take off and fly around.    There are 20-30 large elm (and other trees) in the main courtyard of the administration building.    It was noticeable to the point that students were stopping to take pictures throughout the courtyard and look at them. Nectar sources nearby? There are some flowering plants in yards around town - but other than milkweed, I'm not familiar with what they'd feed on.Overnight temperatures?    It has been pretty consistent the last week or so to get down to about 60 at night for a low. Wind? Were the monarchs shielded from the wind in this location?    I'm not sure of the wind direction or speed.    Yes, fairly shielded as there are several 3 story buildings on campus - as well as the cluster of trees is more than normal out in this panhandle region.

Were the monarchs shielded from the wind in this location? There was little to NO wind that evening.Also the other roost to the east/NE was on the SSW side of the tree.

I wait all year for a few days like these. Some years I never have a day like I had Wednesday, the 25th. My tiny yard had 49 at a time on the asters and goldenrods that I grow on my tiny sliver of yard (16th of an acre not forested). Strong southwest winds perhaps made more of them visit my way station. With winds out of the north they should on the move today.At 61 years old I have learned that sometimes the only thing to do is to go outside and watch and enjoy. So I did! For the last two afternoons I have put my work aside and gone outside to simply be among them and feel the joy of their company.It&rsquo;s been a tough summer here. Lots of spraying for mosquitos from the air and from the road. I was worried about the effects on the migration. But despite the sprays, and apparent lateness, there are lots of monarchs on the move for the past two days up here. We still have New England aster in full bloom and seaside goldenrod is finally in bloom.I let my yard fill with asters and goldenrods this year and let them grow to six feet. (Probably to the dismay of my neighbors!) The monarchs particularly like the taller plants. Migration is so tough - the least I can do is offer the monarchs a sheltered place to feed along their way. Between the wind and difficulty of plants being available at the right times, migration on the coast can be hit or miss.They are coming your way! Hope you planted lots and lots of asters and goldenrods!Thankful in New England, Louise ",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/09/1526430314.jpg,2019-09-25,2019,9,September,39

It&rsquo;s a small 17 acre island that is The American Museum Of Natural History&rsquo;s Research Station in Long Island Sound. It is the site of one of the largest Tern colonies in the world. They cover it with guano and that helps a large crop of Milkweed and Golden Rod....I&rsquo;ve worked there seasonally for 40 years and saw my first Monarchs roosting there then (about 50) on a cold autumn evening (on a privet bush). We often leave the island on Labor Day, but the last few years I&rsquo;ve been out to the end of September. If you're on Facebook at all, I have a page: My View From Great Gull Island that has photos of the island and wildlife etc. Last year I found a couple of small roosts on the island and kept my eyes out this year for them roosting. In September the island is covered with Monarchs, on the 16th this year I found lots of small groups all over the west end of the island (groups of 3-10 ) on Goldenrod. I also found a small roost of about 30 on the now huge Privet.The next day the group was on the privet but also noticed some in the pine grove close by. Numbers went up and down the next few days but very large group on Saturday the 21 (estimate a thousand plus). The next day most seemed to leave the island and Sunday the 22 was very sparse in the trees (a few hundred). It was a week of good wind, the Monarchs roosted in the downwind side of trees. I have video of them also hanging on to the pines in a squall with heavy wind and rain. I'll post it on My View From Great Gull if I already haven&rsquo;t.The biggest number of about 2000 was on the 27What time of day did you observe this roost? ROOST OBSERVED JUST BEFORE SUNSET TO SUNSET AND AGAIN IN MORNING AT SUNRISE, THEY LEAVE THE ROOST WHEN THE SUN HITS THEM.How did you arrive at 2000 adults? SAME AS I DO FOR FLOCKS OF BIRDS- COUNT 10 THEN COUNT BY 10 TO 100 THEN COUNT BY HUNDREDS.Were there any nectar sources nearby, and if so what? ISLAND IS COVERED WITH GOLDENROD AND OTHER WILDFLOWERSWhat was the overnight temperature for the date you observed them?COOLER BUT NO IDEA OF TEMPS.What was the wind direction? Were the monarchs shielded from the wind in this location?

I'm only estimating how many are here at this moment in time because it was getting too dark to see all of them by the time we finished tagging 50 of them. We walked around the property with flashlights and it was clear that they were still occupying the usual cedar trees in high numbers, though not as densely as when I first saw them on September 17th. Our goal this evening was to use the final 50 Monarch Watch tags I had. With a large net, it was easy to capture them and we could have done many, many more had we had more tags.The monarchs were very robust, strong, and their wings almost felt leathery in comparison to those earlier in the season (the non-migratory).Wings measured from 48mm to 54mm, with most being 50-52mm. Nearly all looked very fresh and undamaged. Abdomens were quite plump, no doubt due to the abundant nectar source adjacent to the site. A large field of blooming clover was to the north and to the west.Weather today was cloudy with intermittent light rain, and warm. It was 70 degrees at the time we first got there at 6:30. Winds were light at about 5 mph and out of the northeast.It seems as if the monarchs will be here until the last possible day before cold weather sets in. It's clearly a favored location, though the owner said it's the first time in over 30 years that they've been there like this. Photo attached is from my second visit to this roost on September 18th, when we spotted a female white monarch. This photo shows it in the cluster, but we brought it down to photograph the dorsal side, and then released it.

There were some settling into the willow tree up the bank north of the parking lot and as I took the trail around next to the river and up the bank, there were some settling in, a few at a time, in the trees and shrubs right near the shore. There was really no wind to speak of...I continued to walk toward the grove of trees near the sand volleyball and saw a few other small roosts forming there.

I was able to see 3 roosts on Sunday.  I live in Aurora, NE.  A friend called me about 4:00 pm and said she had some Monarchs in the tree so I went to see them. I think there could have been a couple hundred in that roost. We tagged 35 of them and there were MANY more that we couldn&rsquo;t easily reach.  Most of those were in a crab apple tree.While leaving that site I was called to the Leadership Center, also in Aurora, NE. That is a camp-like conference grounds on the edge of town. There two of the Educators from the Edgerton Science Center in Aurora spotted a roost at least five times larger than the one I had just visited.  At this site they were hanging in several different varieties of trees. Deb M. (from the Edgerton) still had about 100 tags and I still had 25 so we used all of those.  She estimated the number at a thousand.  Actually there may have been more.   I also found another area about a half mile from that one that had about half as many. I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;raising&rdquo; Monarchs for about 15 years and I have NEVER seen anything like this.  It was glorious!The day was quite windy, partly sunny and in the 80&rsquo;s. It got into the 60&rsquo;s that night.  I went back yesterday afternoon (9/30/19) and there were still some in each of the three locations but not nearly as many. Yesterday it was extremely windy with the wind blowing south to north.  I have no idea how they were able to fly in that wind.All 3 locations were fairly well protected from the wind.

I counted the following numbers per minute... 88, 77, 138, 141, 178, 153, 165, 142, 166, 123. These numbers remained high for 45 minutes, averaging 137.1 Monarchs per minute! For the next 15 minutes, they averaged 40 Monarchs per minute. They were a continuous stream, not unlike vehicles going down a highway. I calculated that in my 90 degree cone of view, in a swath less than a quarter-mile wide, I observed over 6000 Monarchs pass overhead in one hour. Rain moved in after the hour's time, and the migrants sought shelter in the timber surrounding the gardens.

Along the pathway there are Russian olive trees, cotton wood and they are surrounded by farm land that includes alfalfa, wheat, milo, and corn.

Each year we watch them pass through but not in the number witnessed that day. <iframe width=""400"" height=""225"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ynjtc8dlaM?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2019/10/1526432270.jpg,2019-09-30,2019,9,September,40

Another live one had discolored wings &amp; another had a v shape cut (bird predation) from it's left lower wing. Strong unfavorable wind will keep them from crossing til around the 24th/25th. Mid aft on the 24th may become favorable &amp; for sure wind lightens on the 25th &amp; a brief northerly wind should allow them to cross the lake. Did not observe any monarchs nectaring or even looking to nectar. Flowers are decreasing but still some Asters in bloom. Outside of the park (like at our home) is where they are seen nectaring on Zinnias, Butterfly bush &amp; sage.

The first report was for the AM, this second report for the PM. I add it because of the noticable increase in monach activity in the PM even compared to the high level of activity in the AM.There is a stretch of greenspace along the waterfront that has been restored for butterflies. This is just south of the ""Waterfront trail"" which is on the north shore of Lake Ontario. The greenspace extends to the edge of some bluffs that drop off before the beach. See  photo from last year.Wildflowers in our area are more stunted this year due to hot dry conditions in July.  To be clear the sightings were not on the beach, but in the upland area at the top of the bluffs. It is similar in many ways to the nearby Scarborough bluffs where Fred Urquart did his work. Often when winds are southward and strong the monarchs fly lower along the bluffs closer to the beach (i.e., instead of along the planted areas) to avoid the winds. This area is a monarch highway during the fall migration each year. Our nature group has been working to help monarchs for several years.

While waiting we saw (and also photographed some of them) at least 50 Monarch Butterflies flying over the road in front, on the rear and over our car. It was an amazing sight. My wife pointing ""look there is another one and another one sometimes in pairs of two"" I tried my best to shoot pictures with my Canon EF 100-400mm telephoto lens and the fabulous 7D Mark II camera. 1. We were stationed on Murchisson road for more than 1 hour (trying to see Sandhill Cranes) our car Volvo V70 was parked with the front window shield heading North and the Butterflies came from the right side (from the East and flew to the west) over Murchisson Road into apparently a corn field but the corn was high and it could be that they just flew over it..3. The weather was nice and sunny - little wind.4. The field to the right was some sort of plants and the Monarchs were stopping and feeding a few seconds.One of my FB contacts a nature specialist Patrick Laniel (he is an employee of Quebec and Canada Nature Parks) wrote the following:Une bonne migration de monarques a eu lieu la semaine pass&eacute;e.

That is the best I could do at estimating the number is somewhere between 75 and 100.  They were roosting along our creek in the box elders and mulberry trees. Most left as the day warmed up but there are still about 25 there again this evening (same day). We noticed them first on the morning of September 1st but they had clearly been there the night before roosting in the trees. My husband found them around 9am. Number: my husband felt there were in the hundreds but he was so astonishrd that was maybe an overestimate. Unfortunately he scared them with his lawnmower and many flew higher up in the trees. He came and got me right away and when we went back, many were swirling around. I counted 50 still roosting quietly on the branches that were approximately eye level and estimated somewhere between 25 and 50 more were flying around us. I could see more in a clump up high roosting but no way of knowing how many. Nectar sources: Amazingly enough, we are an official Monarch Waystation so we have been working on increasing our nectar plants as well as host plants. Never in a million years did we expect this happy result in our waystation! That being said, my interest in monarchs stems from an incident about 20 years ago when suddenly I was surrounded by monarchs on our front lawn. And we have always had many passing through at this time of year so I&rsquo;m wondering now if its possible they have roosted in our trees before and we never knew it. We have one acre of fruit trees but beyond that on the other acre, apart from the foot print of our house, we are gradually working our way into native pollinator gardens. In bloom right now, we have a good supply of goldenrod, purple coneflowers, native phlox, rudbeckia, asters are just coming on and Liatris is just finishing. We also have loads of non natives still that we are gradually replacing. In bloom right now are many rose of sharon, one budleia, hydrangeas and lots of scarlet runner beans in bloom. Weather: wind was quite strong and seemed to be coming more from the south than usual. I&rsquo;m not sure of the temp but it was a warm wind. The monarchs were totally sheltered as they were in a stand of trees in the south east corner of our property that grow on either side of our creek. By 11 am on the 1st most of the butterflies had left but then the weather began to change. It got cooler and the wind was now coming from the north west.

The monarchs were ""flightly"", easily disturbed or startled into flight from nectar sources, and clearly moving with an urgency to both feed and migrate. Clear directional flight westward was obvious, stopping to feed, but if disturbed would either circle back and try landing again on the flowering plant, or take off in a westerly direction, sometimes flying very high in the sky. It was most interesting to see how these monarchs manoevered and soared (as opposed to flapping their wings) in the strong winds, tacking back to a nectar source.  On September 5th, I tagged 104 monarchs. In the photo attached to this report, there were about 200 monarchs at the top of this tree. There may have been other nearby roosts. Photo was taken just before sunset - about 7:30 pm EDT.

I have been talking with my neighbors and over the past week 9/9 - 9/13 we had all noticed seeing many flying around our neighborhood past our windows. We live in downtown Chicago so we were all noting that we were surprised to be seeing so many out our windows and balconies being in high rises.The number was just an estimate because they were in more than one tree and have been flying around our neighborhood so much so I really have no idea how to arrive at a good estimate of how many there were. It might be more in the hundreds? I&rsquo;m not sure.his is a tree next to DuSable Harbor in Chicago, IL. There are trees and plants along the lakefront but then inside our neighborhood square there is a park with lots of flowers. The park I am referencing is Lakeshore East Park in the middle of the block.Overnight Lows were about 60 FI don&rsquo;t recall the wind situation but the trees they were in are somewhat sheltered from the wind, and the park is somewhat sheltered from the wind because it is surrounded by high rise buildings.",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2020/09/1526481010.jpg,2020-09-12,2020,9,September,37

There were 100+ monarchs in the area - too many monarchs to count! They were roosting in nearly every tree in a small grove located in the northwest corner of Maggie Daley park in Chicago, Illinois. I first began seeing multitudes of monarchs flying high above the tall condo buildings in Streeterville/MagMile/River North area the early evening of Wednesday, 09 Sep 2020. It had been raining, yet the monarchs still flew by. On Thursday morning, on my way to work, I saw them again in the same neighborhood. They dissipated from the skies during the day, but again Thursday evening, 10 Sep 2020, they came again - I could see them flying outside my 20th FL office window in Streeterville. It was an incredible sight - one that I had not seen in this neighborhood since the first week or so of September 2017. There were a few stragglers left in the sky on Friday, 11 Sep 2020, but they were mostly gone from the airspace outside my office window. After work, I thought that perhaps I might see a few nectaring at Lurie Garden. On my way, I noticed several monarchs flying above the trees in said corner of Maggie Daley Park, so I walked around to the backside of the trees, and I could not believe my eyes! I'd only seen pictures of such roosts - but never before seen them personally. It was the most spectacular and awe-inspiring sight. 11 Sep 2020 and 12 Sep 2020 were rainy. I returned Saturday, and the roosts were still there. It was raining hard and extremely overcast. I found several other trees throughout the park with large roosts.  The roosts were still there 12 Sep 2020 evening. 13 Sep 2020 was the first sunny, warm, clear day in nearly a week. I went back to the park early between 7-8:45am and the park was alive with monarch butterflies flying around, many basking on the trees, on the pavement, and on the grass. The air was filled with monarchs flying fairly low. I noticed that many monarchs would fly low, and then ""park"" themselves like an airplane on tarmac -- and they were all facing SW. It was uncanny how they were oriented to the same direction. They all parked the same way. I returned the same hour on Monday, 14 Sep 2020, and there was not a single monarch to be seen.  Their complete departure was as striking as their wonderful presence. I'm guessing they may have all departed that sunny Sunday. I would like to note that this year, I saw extremely few monarchs in Chicago during the May-August months were I used to find many.  The first adult monarch I saw was on 24 May 2020 in Lincoln Park. There was no milkweed planted along Upper Wacker. Last year, there was milkweed in the planters, and numerous chrysalises etc. Also, the oval outside Lincoln Park Conservatory was replete with nectaring plants last year. This year, probably due to the pandemic and the mayor leaving parks closed for so long, no flowers had been planted there.

The nectar plants with the highest density of butterflies were Liatris scariosa neuilandii.  The 3.5 acres where this picture was taken has a diverse variety of trees, shrubs, and native wildflowers, surrounded by large corn and soybean fields.I counted as accurately as I could.  This count for nectaring butterflies was made in about an hour, but I didn't time it.  I made several counts of each section of each bed and used the highest number when totalling.  Butterflies were flittering around so I may have counted some twice and not counted others at all.  My large garden of tall wildflowers could only be counted from the perimeter as it is too dense to penetrate.  Therefore, I only counted the butterflies nectaring at the top of the plants I could see and those flying just above the flowers.  I would say this count was low as there were areas of the garden I couldn't observe.There were additional monarchs  resting in many of our trees and shrubs all day on all sides of our property except the south.  Three areas I walked through just after counting the butterflies nectaring each had had 15 to 20 monarchs to fly out of the trees and shrubs.  Fewer flew out elsewhere.

We watched from 5:55 p.m. until 7:10 p.m.I am unable to confirm the date the roost first formed.  Three fellow Masters Gardeners and Master Naturalists and I learned of the roost last year from our county coordinator, Nancy K.  We were excited to observe it last year, but this year the numbers were ""epic"" in the words of fellow observers.  Although I was unable to join them on Tuesday night when between 2,000 and 3,000 were observed, I went the following night.  The numbers were down slightly, but still the monarch roost was a magical sight.My husband and I arrived at our estimate by the following:We traversed the entire grove, marveling at the monarchs.We chose one tree, and together we attempted to count the monarchs in each cluster and the number of clusters in that tree.Again, we traversed the entire grove, tree by tree and did the same thing.When we finished, we compared notes with some other observers.

The ground is littered with monarch wings.I basically used the method of counting a visual extended hand circle and then tried to multiply that number times the number of circles I saw. I figured that there were approximately 200 in the trees roosting and another 300 or so in various other nearby trees and nectaring on a couple of seven son flower trees. 500 feels like a pretty conservative number. With all the other monarchs in the air nectaring at different places around the grounds, I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers were over a thousand if not in the thousands. But 500 would be a safe number for a short blip in time in a small 1/8 acre area of our 18 acre Arboretum.To estimate numbers of butterflies preyed upon by the five kites, I counted roughly 120 wings this morning for an estimated 30 butterflies (4 wings/butterfly). Let's take a wild guess that with all the wings collected yesterday and this weekend, that there have been twice that number preyed upon for a total of 60 butterflies.Today (9/23), with calm conditions they are moving on and there were only about 50 roosting and few nectaring this morning. Update at noon - I only counted a dozen...the migrating kites appear to have moved on as well.[Uncertain when roost first formed] I noticed while camping that the south wind picked up to be a bit stiffer on Saturday the 19th which I'm guessing is when the fallout started. Editor's note: report from another JN observer (KF) at this location suggests that the majority of the roost formed Sept 18 and lasted at least through Sept 22.

This morning, Sept. 22, we counted 117. The day is overcast with a little drizzle, and it doesn't appear they are leaving today.    They have been roosting almost exclusively on the leaves of the lower branches of a large hackberry tree (common hackberry, Celtis occidentalis). This tree is part of a thick hedgerow with large trees at the back (east) edge of our back yard. (A few have also roosted in lower branches of a large red oak in the middle of the back yard..). They have roosted on the north side of branches, giving them some protection from the south winds we have had. (Sunday's winds were up to 14 mph out of the south.).  Additionally, our back yard is shielded quite a bit from the wind in general by a wood fence on three sides (east, south, north), the large oak tree, and our home (2+ stories tall).I am not sure where they are feeding.  We have quite a few flowers in our front and back yard, including lantana and coreopsis, which I have read monarchs like, but we haven't seen the monarchs frequent those.  We have also checked out the vacant land on the other side of our hedgerow and looked for milkweed or other food sources but didn't find any.  We do live in a neighborhood with lots of flowers, and there is still some undeveloped land within a fairly short distance of us (about 1/2 mile away) where they might be finding food.

Most of the individuals came off the bay from the southwest, came to shore, then proceed north along the marsh. So they're going into the wind on an angle. Most of them are very high that are coming in from and/or going north from the bay, but once they come to land and head north they reduce altitude to about 20 or 30ft or so.      Which could mean that they're hopping between peninsulas over the water rather than following the dune line. Then once the Delaware water gap is thin enough further north they cross the bay (maybe when they start to detect less salt in the air or when they can see the shoreline across the bay).

During northwest winds or any north component they typically are pushed against the coast and south. The peninsula of Cape May County acts as a funnel for these migrating monarchs and the majority of the monarchs end up being concentrated at Cape May Point. However, monarchs don&rsquo;t like to cross the Delaware Bay so move north along the Delaware side of the CMC peninsula to a point where the Delaware water gap is not as broad and possibly where they don&rsquo;t detect as much salinity. Then they&rsquo;ll cross at that point as far as we know. So that&rsquo;s why they were headed north. On this particular day there were an abnormal amount of monarchs moving north than usual. None were nectaring in the grounds at the East Point Lighthouse (which is also abnormal), they were all actively migrating. So it was more so the rate at which they were moving north that was significant. Most of the individuals you see around Cape May are feeding for the most part and the ones that do start to move north don&rsquo;t seem to move quite at the rate and at the numbers by which were passing by East Point. The interesting aspect of it, is that while counting the incoming monarchs, the incoming individuals were coming from off the bay (from a southwest direction which makes sense since it was northeast winds. They were going against the winds for uplift) to the point of the peninsula where the East Point Lighthouse is. Then once they reached the lighthouse and thus the shore, they continued north along the beach.  So my guess would be that these individuals coming in from off the bay were coming from another peninsula further south along the Delaware. So instead of riding the typical thermals from the dunes along the coast, they seem to possibly be hopping between the peninsulas that come out in various areas along the Delaware Bay coast of New Jersey. So they cross the water only when there&rsquo;s a visible peninsula on the other side. I work for the Monarch Monitoring Project in Cape May and tag up at East Point on the weekends and can tell you that it was an interesting movement, as it was very constant (as I said an average of 1.4 monarchs per minute for an hour) and in good numbers.

This second wave is much bigger than the first (report Sept. 18).Nectaring on sunflowers, then flying to rest/roost in north side of hedgerow along south side of sunflower field.

There were also several hundred in fields in the area and trying to find places to rest in trees out of the wind. 70 degrees, 20 mph south wind.  Checked on them at 9 am Saturday (9/26), so they would have been there the Friday night (9/25). They were resting there in the hedge trees (osage orange) because they were protected from the stiff south wind.  The hedge row is a half mile long and there were monarchs all along the hedgerow roosting in the trees. We didn't know how to do an accurate count, so 3000 is just a number to indicate there were countless monarchs. There are at least 300 in one tree.  So if you multiply that by a half mile of trees with monarchs in lots of the trees...  3000 is likely an under-estimate.They were also there Saturday night (9/26) before the cold front came through.  The monarchs seemed to be staging there until the next cold front, numbers were building for several days during severe south winds.  We observed them several times....Saturday morning and evening, and the monarchs were there all day.

They were spread throughout multiple trees.Endnote: For nearly 50 years we had access to another ranch 10 miles north east of Sterling city Texas.  Almost every fall around the first week in November monarchs would suddenly appear.  There were hundreds and hundreds of them clustered in the large trees that grew around a natural spring on that ranch.

There are also lots of other flowering plants and crepe myrtles.They most prefer the trees on the west side of the house as the house provides a wind block, but honestly they are everywhere.  Their other favorite area is also shielded by a tennis court wind screen.  They originally started coming 15ish years ago to the oak trees on the west side of the house and since then have steady increase in number such that there is honestly no way for me to quantify them.  When my kids run under the trees they fly and swirl around them.

I could easily see there were a couple of dozen in each of the tall oak trees near me. Across the playground there were more trees and I could see butterflies flying in little flocks and settling back into the trees. Honestly, after looking more closely at my pictures and factoring in all the other trees in the park I could see the number being more like 400-500. I&rsquo;m not sure about nectar sources. I didn&rsquo;t notice flowers in the park but there were open fields to the east of the park playground area.

Tremendous numbers of monarchs have been at Cape May Point for the last 4 days, feeding on seaside goldenrod along the dunes and in various gardens around town.  Roosts of up to 1200 have been found in the late afternoons.  It's impossible to come up with anything resembling an accurate count; 10,000 is certainly low.Additional notes posted 10/12/20: We had seven consecutive days with a lot of monarchs here, which is quite unusual &mdash; usually when we see a big spike in numbers it decreases within 2 or 3 days.  We watched a lot departing on day 5, but more arrived that day and the numbers stayed very high.  Today (10/12/20) is day 8 and it&rsquo;s very rainy and windy - it will be interesting to see how many monarchs will be around when the weather clears.We found between 5 and 10 roosting clusters each night, and often would hear about a roosting group that we hadn&rsquo;t found the next day.  One of our team members methodically counted one of the clusters and came up with 1200.  I feel quite certain that 10,000 is a conservative estimate.During the day we were seeing monarchs nectaring on seaside goldenrod, which grows abundantly on the dunes and upper beach, all the way from Cape May Point to the east end of Cape May City, more than 2 miles distant.  They were also actively nectaring in gardens on flowers such as New England Aster, Mexican Sunflower, Zinnias, Coneflowers, etc., on the flowers of Butterfly Bush and Crape Myrtle, and on the flowers of English Ivy vines, the latter flowers seemingly more than ever.  You couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere within 100 meters of the coast without seeing a lot of monarchs in the air.Temperatures have remained relatively warm throughout this period, so not all monarchs formed roosting clusters overnight, some just settled into the vegetation along the dunes and in other habitats near the shore, while others did cluster &mdash; and those roosting clusters occurred in a variety of plants, including pines, junipers, aspens, and even right in the ivy vines.  We found roosts from the extreme SW corner of Cape May Point east to Cape May Point State Park, and we heard of roosts about 2 miles north near the shores of Delaware Bay, an area known as Town Bank.  There were no doubt some roosting clusters in Cape May City as well, but we didn&rsquo;t search there.Most of the days through this stretch were a bit warmer than the seasonal average with sunny or mostly sunny conditions, winds ranged from light to moderate, from the northwest many days but switching to the southwest several times.  <a href=""https://njaudubon.org/monarch-monitoring/"">Cape May Monarch Monitoring Project Website</a>",//journeynorth.org/jnorth/images/userfiles2020/10/1526490050.jpg,2020-10-08,2020,10,October,41

A few others about 50. others that I could not see.The roosts were in an area that I had walked through earlier. I walked for about 2 hours between 3:30 and 5:30 and observed the roosts from about 5:30 to sundown about 6:20. The roosts are also only visible from the boardwalk. I am not permitted to walk out into the dunes to look for other sites or to get a different angle. so those views are limited. It's been my experience that the roosts are usually on the east side of trees. I have not noted the wind direction with roosts. I have assumed that they are trying to position themselves to get the morning sun. Some of the areas of goldenrod were big patched while others were more interspersed with dune grasses and other plants. Yesterday the butterflies were widely dispersed.

I didn't count the ones I saw in roosts because they were probable the same ones I saw feedingI was using a counter for most of the time I was walking and counted 466. But stopped counting near the end. So I estimated 500. There is a boardwalk that runs through an area of dunes and a road that comes back through a similar but different area. Total length about 1,5 miles. The goldenrod is spread out on both sides of the path. In some places you can see a few hundred feet from the path. In others only a few feet. I counted as many as I could see, realizing that some may have been double counted but that there were also others that would be on plants and not visible. If I double back through an area I don't count in that area again.

I have a certain amount of butterfly bushes, planted specifically for the monarchs. Usually, they arrive, one at the time, and rest on the bushes for a while and then continue their migration after 10-15mn. So, I assume that if I see them leaving, they don&rsquo;t try to fool me by turning around and coming back. If I see, like on Saturday, a constant stream of 4-5 butterflies on the bushes, for a period from 8AM to 4PM or 8H, my count of 20 is probably on a low side. I am out in the yard starting around 8AM and try to check the bushes regularly.    In Fort Lee, I believe we are right on the path of the New England migration; they cross the Hudson over Manhattan, Fort Lee, and Secaucus. I always see them coming from the North-East going South-West. They dive on the butterfly bushes (the only bushes flowering right now), go from bush to bush for nectar, and after 10-15 mn fly over the oak trees and disappear to the South-South-West.
